<p>The Chirp Sensor is low cost a moisture and temperature sensor developed by WeMakeThings: a hackers and engineers collective based in Vilnius, Lithuania. Their hardware and software are fully open-source, and it can be easily integrated but also replicated and customized for new projects. </p>
<p><img alt="Chirp" src="/assets/images/chirp.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>This is a digest of the <a href="">GROW DELIVERABLE 5.3</a> and used in the <a href="">GROW Workshop</a> with a custom <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Outdoor%20Cases%20V2.0-2.1/Mixed%20Solution">enclosure</a></p>
</div>
<p>The sensor uses capacitive sensing to measure soil's moisture. A 1MHz square wave is output from the chip through a resistor into a big pad that, together with the surrounding ground plane, forms a parasitic capacitor. The resistor and the capacitor create a low pass filter whose cut-off frequency changes with changing capacitance. The soil around the sensor acts as an electrolyte whose dielectric constant changes depending on the amount of moisture in it, so the capacitance of our makeshift capacitor changes too. The filtered square wave is then fed into a peak detector formed of out a diode and a capacitor. An ADC measures this voltage in the microcontroller. The sensor also includes a temperature sensor with a calculated absolute measurement accuracy around 2%.</p>
<p>There are different versions of the Chirp sensor, for this example we chose the Chirp I2C sensor. The sensor has been integrated on to the SCK's firmware, and it is automatically recognized by the board once it is plugged into the SCK using the Aux sensor connector. A Grove 4 pin Female Jumper to Grove will need to be soldered to the sensor to connect it to the SCK. The original Chirp sensors come coated with PRF202 - a moisture resistant varnish for electronics. It's ok for playing around in a flower pot but not robust enough for outdoor use. You must add additional protection to the whole sensor after soldering cable. We suggest polyester or epoxy resin. However, you must note that sensitivity of the sensor will decrease depending on how thick the layer you are going to apply and might need to be recalibrated. We also recommend covering the electronics with heat shrink to fully waterproof the sensor. Some versions already include a pre-ruggedized sensor, which is a recommended solution for a faster use.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Calibrate your sensor</p>
<p>The sensor needs to be calibrated in dry and humid conditions. For that, <strong>we will use</strong>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="p">-</span> <span class="nf">A</span> <span class="n">laptop</span> <span class="n">with</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Arduino</span> <span class="n">installed</span><span class="p">](</span><span class="nl">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="c1">//www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)</span>

</pre></div>


<p>The sensor can be calibrated <a href="/Components/Firmware/guides/Using the Shell.md">using the shell</a>. The process reads as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your kit to a computer and open the terminal for the SCK. If you use the Arduino IDE, go to Tools &gt; Serial Monitor and select <code class="codehilite"><span class="mi">115200</span> <span class="n">baud</span></code> at the bottom right corner
<img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/hs5Ny7Q.png" />
<br></li>
<li>If you use the IDE type <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">sensor</span></code> on the top and click <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">Send</span></code></li>
<li>Check if the output has something like <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Soil</span> <span class="n">Moisture</span> <span class="n">Raw</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">60</span> <span class="n">sec</span><span class="p">)</span></code> after <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Enabled</span></code></li>
<li>If it's <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Enabled</span></code>, <strong>dry the sensor</strong> and type in: <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">read</span> <span class="n">soil</span> <span class="n">moisture</span> <span class="n">raw</span></code>. Repeat this command 5-10 times until you get an stable output (repeat command with <em>arrow up</em>)</li>
<li>Put the sensor in a cup of water (until the line). Then read the value again <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">read</span> <span class="n">soil</span> <span class="n">moisture</span> <span class="n">raw</span></code> several times.</li>
<li>Once you have both values, type in: <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">control</span> <span class="n">moisture</span> <span class="n">cal</span> <span class="n">XXX</span> <span class="n">YYY</span></code> where XXX and YYY are the dry and wet values that you just measured</li>
<li>Check that the reading is OK by: <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">read</span> <span class="n">soil</span> <span class="n">moisture</span> <span class="n">percent</span></code>. You should receive an answer in rh%</li>
<li>Now you should see the data online (if in network mode):</li>

<p>Having a robust portfolio of the sensor for measuring soil and water characteristics is a need found by many farming communities, primarily when they are working on new ways of growing crops. In this direction, we include a collection of sensors that despite not being low cost or open source, they are still affordable and well documented when compared to other commercial solution. From a cost perspective, they are not aimed at being massively deployed but instead used individually in a specific site for specific needs.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4912/46225599704_bd7d0abec5_k.jpg" /></p>
<p>The sensors selected are from Atlas Scientific, a New York-based company that <em>converts devices that were originally designed to be used by humans into devices that are specifically designed to be used by robots</em>. As already mentioned the sensors are not entirely open source as the other sensors documented on this section. However, they are modular and exceptionally well documented by the manufacturer. That includes documentation on how to install, calibrate and integrate them with additional existing hardware. In this direction, we developed a full library for the SCK to support the sensors via the Auxiliary sensor connector. We also developed a Python script to simplify the calibration process of the sensors. As the sensors can be configured in different ways, we do not provide a full step-by-step guide. Instead, we refer to the documentation on the <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-grow/tree/master/soil-water-probes">project's repository</a>.</p>
<p>The setup is built out of the following main components: </p>
<ul>
<li>Atlas Scientific Sensor Probe: The physical probe we will insert on to the soil (or water).</li>
<li>Atlas Scientific EZO Circuit: The driver that will read the analog signal coming from the Sensor Probe and turn it into a meaningful numeric value by applying the different calibration operations. </li>
<li>Whitebox Labs Tentacle T3: The motherboard that puts everything together and hosts up to 3 Atlas Scientific Probes. It connects to the SCK via the Aux sensor connector. This boards can be chained to support more sensors, but this is not documented at the moment. </li>
<li>SEEED Grove - 4 pin Female Jumper to Grove 4 pin Conversion</li>

</ul>
<p>Different sensor probes can be selected for different needs. For example the setup shown above is designed for soil measurements and includes Atlas Scientific temperature, conductivity and PH probes. It also consists of a Chirp Moisture Sensor as described in the <a href="/Toolkit/guides/soil/#moisture-sensor">above section</a>. As an additional example the setup in the figure below is designed for water monitoring on aquaponics systems and includes Atlas Scientific probes for PH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen.</p>

<p>This version is a WIP but is not fully functional with the SCK 2.1. It is shown here as a demosntrator of the project's capabilities. Have a look at the forum or drop us an email to discuss this.</p>

<p>Soil Moisture data as the one provided by the Chirp Moisture Sensor is interesting for research, but when it comes to crops irrigation management, we usually like to know the soil water tension (SWT). That is because Soil Moisture in water is not directly related to the water plants roots might be able to extract because it is deeply affected by the soil composition. Even soil irrigation can be inferred from soil moisture when the soil type is known we think a soil tensiometer. Also when it is a simple solution, it is a useful tool for crops management.</p>
<p><img alt="Watermark Tensionmeter Demo" src="/assets/images/watermark.png" /></p>
<p>The design is entirely open source and it is deeply inspired by the work of Reinier Van der Lee from the <a href="http://vanderleevineyard.com/vineyard-blog.html">Vinduino project</a>. The sensor design is straightforward and it consists of two stainless steel screws that work as electrodes cast inside a piece of plaster and covered by a plastic mesh to prevent erosion. As water is added more electrons can pass between the electrodes of the probe reducing the amount of resistance between them. By using this range of values, you can determine the amount of water that exists in your soil. To avoid interferences and degradation of the electrodes the design only applies voltage for a very short time and uses alternating electric polarities. For the sensor to work, we need a minimal circuit that uses two resistors and two diodes. The resistors work together with the electrodes to build a voltage divider. We can calculate the resistance value between the two electrodes by knowing the value of the resistors and the voltage. However to be able to alternate the electric current we need to duplicate the circuit and add two diodes. In total, we need 4 Pins to be connected to a microcontroller like the Arduino or the Smart Citizen Kit. On pin 8 we will read the voltage while the other pin is providing power and then it will flip to the other two to keep reversing the current flow. The circuit can be simply built using basic electronic components on a stripboard PCB (printed circuit board).</p>

<p>By default, the sensor is not calibrated, but we can still relatively use the values to understand when to water our plants however to obtain the soil tension we will need to calibrate them using a commercial tensiometer. To avoid this problem, we can use an already calibrated commercial probe like the Watermark 200SS9 using the same driving circuit for the SCK as the DIY version.</p>
