<h2 id="how-do-i-register-again-my-sck">How do I register again my SCK?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-register-again-my-sck" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>It is really important to understand a SCK can be just registered one time to one device in the platform.</p>
<p><em>Imagine how confusing it will be a single physical device publishing as two separate kits on the platform in two different locations!</em></p>
<p>That's why you will need to <em>unlink</em> your SCK before you can register it again as another kit or when you would like to give your device to someone else to use it.</p>
<p><img alt="Register The Kit" src="/assets/images/sck_1/mac_1.png" /></p>
<p>Go to your Kits profile <a href="https://smartcitizen.me/profile/kits">page</a> select the kit you will like to unlink and go to <strong>Setup</strong>. You don't need to connect your SCK, just scroll down, remove the Mad Address number from the field and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p><em>This way your kit will keep all the data on the platform but you will be able to register your SCK again as another kit. You can alway register again your SCK on the same device by following the standard setup process.</em></p>

<p>The Smart Smart Citizen Kit is designed to work with most home and office standard Wi-Fi routers and access points. However we do not support network names or passwords longer than <em>19 characters</em> or with a <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">$</span></code> character.</p>
<p>We also do not support <strong>WPA Enterprise</strong> networks or <strong>Captive portal</strong> log in as the ones on some big companies and airports. We suggest you contact your IT support team, they can enable you special access in the network based on your device <strong>Mac Address</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-sd-card">How to use the SD Card?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-the-sd-card" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>microSD</strong>: We recommend formatting <strong>micro SD</strong> cards using the official SD tool you can download <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RTC</strong>: Place a <strong>CR1220</strong> cell battery on your kit. Before uploading the SD firmware use the on-line configuration tool at <a href="https://smartcitizen.me">smartcitizen.me</a> to set your Wi-Fi credentials. Turn your kit off and on for a minute, the blue led's will blink and your kit will connect to the internet and sync its the internal clock with our remote servers. Once the time is set the cell battery will keep SCK time in sync for more than 4 years.</p>

<p><strong>SD data format</strong></p>
<p>When using the <strong>SD firmware</strong> on the SCK, data is stored as <strong>CSV</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma separated</a>) file on the SD card.</p>
<p>This is an example of the output file once opened on a spreadsheet application:</p>

<strong>How to proceed</strong></p>
<p>Here are the different paths you can take in order to built your own backend:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a fork of the the <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/Smart-Citizen-Kit/tree/master" target="_blank">Smart Smart Citizen Kit firmware</a> in order to send the data as your custom backend expect it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create your own custom backend. We can share all the different modules of our backend in order for you to receive data as on the curl example above, calibrate it and store it. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smartcitizen.me"><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep using our backend but request our API <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/" target="_blank">developer.smartcitizen.me</a> and then fill database choosen with it.</p>

<p>In Windows you will need to install the Arduino Drivers if you haven't done it before.</p>
<h3 id="windows-8-7-vista-and-xp">Windows 8, 7, Vista, and XP<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-8-7-vista-and-xp" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Arduino <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">download page</a> and download the latest version of the Arduino software for Windows.</li>
<li>When the download is finished, un-zip it and open up the Arduino folder to confirm that yes, there are indeed some files and sub-folders inside. The file structure is important so don’t be moving any files around unless you really know what you’re doing.</li>
<li>Power up your Smart Smart Citizen Kit by connecting it to your computer with a USB cable. You should see the green LED near the on/off switch light up.</li>
<li>If you’re running Windows 8, you’ll need to disable driver signing, so go see the Windows 8 section. If you’re running Windows 7, Vista, or XP, you’ll need to install some drivers, so head to the Windows 7, Vista, and XP section down below.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="windows-8">Windows 8<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-8" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Windows 8 comes with a nice little security ‘feature’ that ‘protects’ you from unsigned driver installation. The Smart Smart Citizen Kit driver is not signed so you’ll have to tell Windows to disable driver signing. This issue has been addressed in newer releases of the Arduino IDE, but if you run into issues, you can try this fix first.</p>
<p>For a nice, step-by-step tutorial with pictures <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/disabling-driver-signature-on-windows-8/overview">click here</a>, otherwise the steps are outlined below.</p>
<p>To <em>temporarily</em> disable driver signing:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the Metro Start Screen, open Settings (move your mouse to the bottom-right-corner of the screen and wait for the pop-out bar to appear, then click the Gear icon)</li>
<li>Click ‘More PC Settings’</li>
<li>Click ‘General’</li>
<li>Scroll down, and click ‘Restart now’ under ‘Advanced startup’.</li>
<li>Wait a bit.</li>
<li>Click ‘Troubleshoot’.</li>
<li>Click ‘Advanced Options’</li>
<li>Click ‘Windows Startup Settings’</li>
<li>Click Restart.</li>
<li>When your computer restarts, select ‘Disable driver signature enforcement‘ from the list.</li>
</ul>
<p>To <em>permanently</em> disable driver signing (recommended, but has some minor security implications):</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the metro start screen</li>
<li>Type in “cmd”</li>
<li>Right click “Command Prompt” and select “Run as Administrator” from the buttons on the bottom of your screen</li>
<li>Type/paste in the following commands: bcdedit -set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON</li>
<li>Reboot!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="windows-7-vista-and-xp">Windows 7, Vista, and XP<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-7-vista-and-xp" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Installing the Drivers for the Arduino Uno (from Arduino.cc)</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug in your board and wait for Windows to begin it’s driver installation process</li>
<li>After a few moments, the process will fail, despite its best efforts</li>
<li>Click on the Start Menu, and open up the Control Panel</li>
<li>While in the Control Panel, navigate to System and Security. Next, click on System</li>
<li>Once the System window is up, open the Device Manager</li>
<li>Look under Ports (COM &amp; LPT). You should see an open port named “Arduino UNO (COMxx)”. If there is no COM &amp; LPT section, look under ‘Other Devices’ for ‘Unknown Device’</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/assets/images/sck_1/windows_driver_1.png"><img alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/sck_1/windows_driver_1.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the “Arduino UNO (COMxx)” or “Unknown Device” port and choose the “Update Driver Software” option</li>
<li>Next, choose the “Browse my computer for Driver software” option</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/assets/images/sck_1/windows_driver_2.png"><img alt="alt text" src="/assets/images/sck_1/windows_driver_2.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, navigate to and select the Uno’s driver file, named “ArduinoUNO.inf”, located in the “Drivers” folder of the Arduino Software download (not the “FTDI USB Drivers” sub-directory). If you cannot see the .inf file, it is probably just hidden. You can select the ‘drivers’ folder with the ‘search sub-folders’ option selected instead.</li>
<li>Windows will finish up the driver installation from there</li>

<p>Is your SCK quite far away from Wi-Fi access point? You can use an external antenna with your SCK.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi modules has a U.FL antenna connector. We recommend you to use a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/662">U.FL to RP-SMA adaptor</a> in order to use <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/558">standard Wi-Fi antennas</a>. You then will need to enable the <em>External Antenna</em> on the <a href="http://docs.smartcitizen.me/#/start/adding-a-smart-citizen-kit">Wi-Fi setup process</a> by selecting <em>External Antenna</em>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-leds-for-and-what-does-the-led-blinking-mean">What are the LEDs for, and what does the LED blinking mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-leds-for-and-what-does-the-led-blinking-mean" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>There are 5 LEDs, they are all on the base half of the SCK.  They can be understood in three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LED2 and LED1 - These are the two yellow (or orange) LEDs in the lower center-left of the board.  You will only see these lit when your USB cable is connected to the SCK and you are configuring or otherwise interacting with the SCK.  LED2 is the "RX USB" and will be lit when the SCK is receiving information via the USB connection. LED1 is the "TX USB" and will be lit when the SCK is sending information via the USB connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LED4 and LED3 - These are the two blue LEDs in the lower center of the board.  You will see these blink often. LED3 is the "WiFi Association" and LED4 is the "WiFi Connection." The blue LEDs will blink each time the SCK posts new data wirelessly. This is normal behavior and is expected, but it only happens in bursts (then there will be no blue LED lit for about 30-40 seconds). If your blue LEDs are blinking back and forth non-stop, this means your SCK has lost its WiFi connection. Check to make sure your router is still on, and that you're still in range of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LED5 - This is the green LED in the upper left corner.  It will be lit when the SCK is turned on and has power.</p>
</li>
</ul>
