<p>This happens when one application is already using the serial port. For example, if you have the Arduino IDE serial monitor opened and you're trying to configure your SCK through the web browser. You have yo close the serial monitor first.</p>
<h2 id="no-port-available">No port available<a class="headerlink" href="#no-port-available" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>This message will appear when you have uploaded the wrong firmware version to your SCK.</p>

<p>If you're getting the message "Error in connection" when you run the SCK firmware this may be due:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your router works with a protocol different than 802.11AG</li>
<li>You have set wrong SSID name and/or password</li>
<li>Your network has an encryption different than OPEN, WEP, WPA1, WPA2 OR WEP64</li>

<h2 id="no-data-received-yet">No data received yet<a class="headerlink" href="#no-data-received-yet" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>This message appears the first time you register your kit, is due to cache issues. This issue normally is fixed after a few hours, in any case we are working to improve this issue.</p>

<p>This may be due:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SCK is turned off.</li>
<li>The USB cable you're using has wired only power cable and not the data cables.</li>
<li>The bootloader is corrupted.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're having problems updating the firmware you can try one of these two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the latest firmware through the web browser configurator.</li>
<li>Update the latest firmware through Arduino IDE.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still having problems it's may be due to a hardware or software issue, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@smartcitizen.me"><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a></a>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to show you how turn an Arduino into AVR ISP to burn the bootloader to your SCK.</p>
<p><em>The bootloader is a small piece of code running inside your Smart Smart Citizen Kit allowing it to be programmed and configured over USB. If suddenly you do not see anymore the USB / Serial port when connecting your Kit to a Computer maybe your bootloader crashed and it is time to reinstall it.</em></p>
