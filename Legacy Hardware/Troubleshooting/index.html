<p>If you're getting the message "Error in connection" when you run the SCK firmware this may be due:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your router works with a protocol different than 802.11AG</li>
<li>You have set wrong SSID name and/or password</li>
<li>Your network has an encryption different than OPEN, WEP, WPA1, WPA2 OR WEP64</li>

<ul>
<li>Update the latest firmware through the web browser configurator.</li>
<li>Update the latest firmware through Arduino IDE.</li>

<p>In this tutorial we are going to show you how turn an Arduino into AVR ISP to burn the bootloader to your SCK.</p>
<p><em>The bootloader is a small piece of code running inside your Smart Smart Citizen Kit allowing it to be programmed and configured over USB. If suddenly you do not see anymore the USB / Serial port when connecting your Kit to a Computer maybe your bootloader crashed and it is time to reinstall it.</em></p>
