## Sections

* **Main:** Contains the [**Smart Citizen Kit**](Smart Citizen Kit) and [**Smart Citizen Stations**](Smart Citizen Station) documentation to help you use them.

* **Components:** Contains all the documentation on the different [**hardware sensor modules**](Components) with detailed insights on the sensors behaviour and calibration.

* **Legacy Hardware:** Are you a pioneer of participatory sensing looking for the original SCK 1.0 and SCK 1.1 documentation? Check the [**Legacy Hardware**](Legacy Hardware) section!

* **Sensor Analysis Framework:** Contains all the documentation on the [**data post-processing framework**](Sensor Analysis Framework) to obtain insights from the data calibrated by the sensors.

* **Sensor Platform:** Contains all the documentation on the [**sensors web platform**](Sensor Platform) where data is collected, stored and visualised.

## Guides

The documentation contains multiple guides as step-by-step tutorials to perform essential tasks as installing a sensor type or uploading the software on the sensors.
