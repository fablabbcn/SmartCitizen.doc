## Sections

* **Main:** Contains the [**Smart Citizen Kit**](Smart Citizen Kit) and [**Smart Citizen Station**](Smart Citizen Station) documentation to help you use them.

* **Platform:** Contains all the documentation on the [**online platform**](Sensor Platform) where data is collected, stored and visualised.

* **Data Analysis:** Contains all the documentation on the [**data post-processing framework**](Sensor Analysis Framework) to obtain insights from the data calibrated by the sensors.

* **Use cases:** Contains documentation and [**use cases**](Use Cases) examples how to use our tools with your local community.

* **Guides:** Contains step-by-step [**guides**](Guides) for different features of the kit, how to get started, use the shell, or make some more advanced analysis of the sensor readings!

* **Legacy Hardware:** Are you a pioneer of participatory sensing looking for the original SCK 1.0 and SCK 1.1 documentation? Check the [**Legacy Hardware**](Legacy Hardware) section!

## Guides

The documentation contains multiple [guides](/Guides) as step-by-step tutorials to perform essential tasks as installing a kit or upgrading it's firmware as well.
