_Final iSCAPE Station version (iSCAPE-V2.0)_

The Smart Citizen Station aims at providing a solution that can be used by Citizens and Researchers to gather _advanced air pollution data_ not only from a scientific point of view but also as a tool to engage local communities on air pollution related issues.

    The **iScape Living Lab Station 1.0** was the development version for the 2.0 version. It was sponsored thanks to the [iSCAPE project](https://www.iscapeproject.eu/) under European Communityâ€™s H2020 Programme under Grant Agreement No. [689954](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/202639/en)

_Middle iSCAPE Station version (iSCAPE-V1.0)_

The station is designed with a modular principle where sensors can be added easily added expanding the capabilities of the installation or replaced when they are damaged or the sensors lifetime is over. From a costs perspective while being more expensive than the Smart Citizen Kit it is also conceived as a low-cost solution.

The design builds on top of the Smart Citizen Kit adding an extra set of more accurate sensors especially aimed at measuring air pollutants. The sensors include:

- Gas sensors for gases such as CO, NO2, NO, O3, SO2, H2S among others
- PM sensors from Plantower or others
- Environmental metrics: temperature, humidity, pressure
- Noise levels and FFT spectrum
