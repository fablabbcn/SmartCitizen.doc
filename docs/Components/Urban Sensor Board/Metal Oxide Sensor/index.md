Metal Oxide sensors
===================================

The Smart Citizen Kit has been using metal oxide sensors for air quality metrics for a long time, and we thought that it would be interesting to dedicate a section for them!

In this section, we will compile information available for those using the SCK V2.0 (or before) with the SGX MICS 4514 and the SCK V2.1, with the AMS CCS811.

Check the links below for more information about the specifics of:

- CO - NO~2~ sensor from V2.0 and before? Click [here](Metal Oxide Sensor/MICS/)
- eCO2 - TVOC sensor from V2.1? Click [here](/Components/Urban Sensor Board/Metal Oxide Sensor/CCS811/)
