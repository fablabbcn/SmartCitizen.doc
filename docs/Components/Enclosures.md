If we want to leave the kit on the outside for a few days you will need to provide it with extra protection. Below you can see the well-known 3D printed enclosure (for versions without PM sensor):

!!! info "A note about the enclosures"
    Previous versions of the Smart Citizen Kit, without the PMS5003 sensor, included a 3D printed enclosure that holds the Data Board and Urban Sensor Board, as well as the lithium batteries. Different versions are available for the SCK 2.1, either with a [CNC'ed](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Outdoor%20Cases%20V2.0-2.1/Milled%20HDPE) version, or [3D printed one](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Outdoor%20Cases%20V2.0-2.1/3D%20Printed%20Prototype). Currently, there is no mass produced version at SEEED.

See the CNC'ed HDPE version:

### A _very_ DIY enclosure

!!! warning
    Keep in mind that casing is designed for short outdoor deployments. If you want a case for long exhibitions abroad, we will soon have a much more rugged enclosure ready! Also, feel free to explore all our [enclosures repository](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures) for this and other versions of our hardware.

!!! example "Step by step"

    **First, you will need the two 3D printed clips. You can [download the STL](https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/blob/master/SmartCitizen%20DIY%20Clips%20V2.0-2.1/3D%20Print%20Clips.stl) file and print them easily on any RepRap or similar FDM printer. If you don't know how to find a 3D printer, you can look for your nearest [Fab Lab](https://www.fablabs.io/labs) or use [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com/3dprint).**
