# Use cases

The Smart Citizen project has had the chance to be part of fantastic projects throughout it's brief history. Ranging from public interventions in urban areas to the development of DIY sensors for agriculture, the team has carried out an enormous efforts to develop a technical platform that supports a wide range of communities on the creation of participatory sensing initiatives.

This section is a summary of these projects that might inspire you in future actions. They show the vast amount of possibilities offered by the Smart Citizen tools as key enablers of participatory sensing pilots and experiments.

By providing meaningful examples of novel appropriations and uses we seek to  spire communities to conduct their own experiments and, hopefully, even their  own custom tools.
