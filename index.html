<p>The project's sensor platform builds on the legacy of previous Smart Citizen Kit generations to develop a new set of tools especially aimed at providing meaningful data insights on a low budget. The system is designed in a extendable way, with a central data logger with network connectivity to which the different components are branched and aims to give support to a various activities ranging from education to more advanced scientific research.</p>
