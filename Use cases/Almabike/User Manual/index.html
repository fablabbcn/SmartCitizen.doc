<p>The selected NEO-M8U GPS Breakout from Sparkfun is a high quality GPS board. The NEO-M8U takes advantage of u-blox's Untethered Dead Reckoning (UDR) technology. The NEO-M8U module is a 72-channel u-blox M8 engine GNSS receiver, meaning it can receive signals from the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou constellations with <strong>~2.5 meter accuracy</strong>. The module supports concurrent reception of three GNSS systems. The combination of GNSS and integrated 3D sensor measurements on the NEO-M8U provide accurate, real-time positioning rates of up to 30Hz.</p>
<p>Compared to other GPS modules, this breakout maximizes position accuracy in dense cities or covered areas. Even under poor signal conditions, continuous positioning is provided in urban environments and is also available during complete signal loss (e.g. short tunnels and parking garages). Lock time is further reduced with on-board rechargeable battery; there is a backup power enabling the GPS to get a hot lock within seconds.</p>
<p>The SparkFun NEO-M8U GPS Breakout is also equipped with an on-board rechargeable battery that provides power to the RTC on the NEO-M8U. This reduces the time-to-first fix from a cold start (~26s) to a hot start (~1.5s). The battery will maintain RTC and GNSS orbit data without being connected to power for plenty of time.</p>

<li>It is a widely available enclosure by a well stablished bike equipment manufacturer</li>
<li>Size and materials</li>
<li>Low weight and flexible outter fitting for low vibrations and transmissibility</li>
</ul>
<p>The sensors are internally suspended by a polypropilene folding and the air intakes are made out of PLA in a 3D printer.</p>

<p>This will be improved with new Firmware Features. Current battery duration is 1 day with 2-3 short bicycle trips of 30' each. This will improve with upcoming firmware updates.</p>
</div>
<p>The SCK comes with a 2000mAh LiPo battery to provide autonomy while measuring in the city. The battery is meant to be a complete power option for short-term measurements (approximatively 1-2 days). The battery duration is dependent on which sensors are enabled or disabled, and the amount of time the dynamic measurement interval is active.</p>
<p>You will note that the kit <em>turns itself off</em> while operating on battery. Actually, this is what we call <code>sleep-mode</code>, an operation mode implemented to reduce consumption while on battery operation.</p>
<h3 id="battery-charging">Battery charging<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-charging" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The SCK has a micro USB port and can be charged like any Smartphone or Tablet using a dedicated adapter or a computer USB port.</p>
<p>We recommend using a tablet power adaptor, instead of a computer USB port, for quicker charging.</p>
<h3 id="user-feedback">User feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#user-feedback" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The LED serves as an indication of the battery status. If the LED is flashing orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> it indicates that the battery must be charged. The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will change from orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/buttons.png" /></p>
<p><em>Remember that in addition to these colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd.</em></p>

<h2 id="data-acquisition">Data Acquisition<a class="headerlink" href="#data-acquisition" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Data can be recorded offline or published online to the Smart Citizen Platform. The SCK owner needs to configure how the data is going to be stored in the Setup process, either in the SD card or via network connectivity (WiFi) to the platform. </p>
<p>When the SCK is configured in <em>sdcard mode</em>, it will store the data at the <strong>requested interval*</strong> in the SD card.</p>
<p>In the case of network connectivity, in normal conditions, the device will send data over to the Smart Citizen Platform via WiFi (WPA2 Personal or WEP). Additionally, when configured to send data over WiFi, if there is a SD card present, it will also store the data in it as a backup. Finally, in the special case of mobile sensors, where network connectivity is not always present, the data can be recorded offline on its internal dedicated flash memory of 8MB and later publish this over WiFi connectivity. Data is published using MQTT messages to the Smart Citizen Platform. NTP is used for syncing the built-in RTC.</p>
<h3 id="recording-interval">Recording interval<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-interval" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In order to understand the reading and publication intervals, it is important to describe how the structure of the measurements is done:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overall reading interval</strong>: base period for the SCK to take a measurement</li>
<li><strong>Individual sensor reading interval</strong>: period for each sensor to take a measurement. It is defined as N times the <em>Overall reading interval</em></li>
<li><strong>Publication interval</strong>: time for the SCK to publish to the Smart Citizen Platform, independent of the reading interval.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the sensors can be configured independently, with a reading interval N times the <em>overall reading interval</em>. For the Almabike project, all the sensors are read every 60s if the sensors are static. When a GPS movement is detected, the reading interval goes down to 5s.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/interval.png" /></p>
<p>In the case of <strong>the Almabike project</strong>, the sensors store data internally in the Flash memory during the bicycle trips and publish it in batch when the configured WiFi network is visible. Data is also stored in the SD card for later use in CSV file format.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/trip.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="user-interfaces">User interfaces<a class="headerlink" href="#user-interfaces" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The data board features a set of user interfaces which provide feedback to the user, as well as two buttons with different functionalities. The main RGB LED provides general feedback of the data board status. Additionally, two buttons are provided for user action. A hardware reset button, which forces a power cut to the board, and a power button, used to change the device's mode, turn on and off the device, and to perform a factory reset. You can see both buttons below:</p>

<p>The files in the sdcard have the following naming: YYYY-MM-DD.CSV, however, you will find in the some extra files (.01, .02...) These are data files that the sensor creates once there is a reset and, to avoid corruption, it creates a new file in the sd-card, by changing the file-extension.</p>
<p>A <strong>complete reset takes place every night at 3-4am</strong> with the purpose to avoid data loss because a problem. The SCK then stores the data in a file with a sequential name, and does so by changing the filename to YYYY-MM-DD.01, .02… etc depending on the amount of resets it sees during that day. You can see the data and work with it by changing the name from YYYY-MM-DD.01 to YYYY-MM-DD_01.CSV</p>

<p>Notes about data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non valid data is shown in CSV as <code>null</code></li>
<li>There is no correction in the data</li>
<li>The minimum refresh interval for the PM sensor is 1s (it won't change faster than that)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The sensor comes mounted and almost ready to be used.</p>
<p>The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) and we will be able to configure it by following the instructions at <a href="https://start.smartcitizen.me">start.smartcitizen.me</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/start.png" /></p>
<p>After the configuration process, data will be available on the SmartCitizen platform. You can explore the data there or download it using the <code>CSV Download</code> option (guide <a href="https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Guides/Downloading%20the%20Data/">here</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/csv.png" /></p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Make sure data is recorded</p>
<p>For the <strong>Almabike project</strong>, it is important to follow the steps below in order to select the correct <em>kit blueprint</em> while registering the sensor:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the 🛠️ icon in the bottom right corner</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../assets/icon.png" /></p>

<ol>
<li>The kit is either in <a href="#sd-card-mode-offline">SD card</a> or <a href="#wi-fi-mode">network mode</a></li>
<li>The kit has enough battery (check the <a href="#user-feedback">status of the LED</a>)</li>
<li>The GPS has a fix in outdoor space (<a href="#gps">GPS Blue LED is blinking</a>). If the GPS Blue LED is not blinking, make sure it's powered and extract the package from the saddle bag and let it get a valid fix in a clear sky view</li>

<p>Below, there is a list of known issues with the <code>0.9.8</code> version of the Firmware. These will be fixed soon.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Currently, the SCK does not report errors permanently and only during 10s. This is shown as a fast led blinking (<span class="led net-error"></span>). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under certain conditions, the dynamic interval is not instantly recovered after a quick stop, and it might take 1' to restart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under certain sky visibility conditions, the GPS does not report a valid fix. It is normally fixed with a clear sky view. For this, follow the instructions in <a href="#before-going-on-a-trip">Before going on a trip</a></p>
