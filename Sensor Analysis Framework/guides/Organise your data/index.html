<p>The <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">data</span></code> directory will be the place where we will organise our data. Each of the sub-directories is explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">export</span></code>: we will export processed data or images here</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">interim</span></code>: we will place files used internally for the framework, such as sensor calibration data</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">processed</span></code>: the most important folder of our data directory. This will contain a hierarchy with the different tests after loading into our database. The tests in this folder will have an unified format to easily navigate them. It's the folder we will load our data from, once we have <a href="#Create a test">created a test</a>.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">raw</span></code>: raw sdcard data can be placed here. It will feed our test creation script below</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">scripts</span></code>: a compilation of handy scripts to parse excel files, concatenate csvs and more</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-test">The test<a class="headerlink" href="#the-test" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>We have mentioned several times that we will organise our data in tests. The concept is very simple. A test is a collection of devices (SCKs or not), that have a common purpose. They can be located in the same spot (co-location) or not, and the main idea is that we centralise the data in a common instance for easy analysis.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<image src="https://i.imgur.com/CSi5tL4.png" width="500px"/>
</div>

<p>Tests have dates, authors, can have comments (for us to remember what we did), a report attached and can be in different conditions (outdoor, indoor)... We will put all this metadata in a <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">yaml</span></code> file to help use look for the tests later on. </p>
<p>Tests can also have different sources. They could be csv files, xls files or data from the Smart Citizen API. For the local files, we will first pre-process them with the scripts in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">data</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">scripts</span></code> folder and then place them in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">data</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">raw</span></code> folder, in csv format. We use this format because it's a common usable format and, although it is not the most efficient way of archiving the data, it can be easily explored by other common applications.</p>
<h3 id="pre-process-the-sd-card-data">Pre-process the sd card data<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-process-the-sd-card-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In order to make our files usable, we will need to have them in a format like <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">YY</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">MM</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DD</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CSV</span></code>. However, if the kit has some sensors connected, we can find some files like: <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">YY</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">MM</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DD</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">01</span></code>, <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">YY</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">MM</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DD</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">02</span></code> and they should be something like <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">YY</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">MM</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DD_01</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CSV</span></code>, <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">YY</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">MM</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">DD_02</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">CSV</span></code>...</p>

<p>We have two main methods to load data into the framework: a test (coming from sd card data or API), and the API, directly. Run the following piece of code in your <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">notebook</span></code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">%run</span> <span class="n">src_ipynb</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ipynb</span>

<p>And then:</p>

<p>This will open an interface to load data from either source, explained below.</p>

<p>If you have local tests created as defined <a href="/Sensor Analysis Framework/guides/Organise your data/#create-a-test">here</a>, the tests will appear in the selection box. You can select as many as you want, and select the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">target</span> <span class="n">frequency</span></code> and what to do with <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">NaN</span></code> values.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Decide this now</p>
<p>It is better to decide this now and not when we create the test. Better to have the information available always and process it each time on load than vice-versa.</p>

<p>The set of options below will try to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Load the process CSV files: in case you have some previous work done, it will load it (it should be in the processed folder of each test)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load cached API data: if you have loaded this test previously, and if you have previously marked the option below, it will load the data directly from your disk, to avoid loading it again from the API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save API data: will try to cache this data in the disk for later use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we can click on <code class="codehilite"><span class="k">Load</span></code> and it will proceed to load your test. A normal output is shown below:</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Pro-tip</p>
<p>If you want to include your API devices in a test that you created, you can select it in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Merge</span> <span class="k">with</span><span class="p">...</span></code> drop-down. Remember that this won't update the test.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="modify-data">Modify data<a class="headerlink" href="#modify-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The data structure is based on a python dictionary, which contains a lot of information regarding the devices. The devices in a test can be accesed with:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">records</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">readings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;TEST_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;devices&#39;</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="n">keys</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The data for a particular device can be accessed like:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">records</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">readings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;TEST_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;devices&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;DEVICE_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;data&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In it, we have a <a href="http://www.pandas.org">pandas</a> dataframe. We can check the columns in it by:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">records</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">readings</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;TEST_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;devices&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;DEVICE_NAME&#39;</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="s1">&#39;data&#39;</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="n">columns</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>We can manipulate the dataframe at will. However, we have added a handy calculator:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="nf">%run</span> <span class="n">src_ipynb</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">calculator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ipynb</span>

<p>Here you should see something like:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/6C5OShB.png" /></p>
<p>When you select a test, the devices will show in the selection box. If you select multiple devices, the common channels will be selectable in the drop down below. You can select each term (up to 4) and create a formula in the bottom-right text box. This accepts common expressions, as well as numpy expressions. An example is shown in the image above. When you hit <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Calculate</span></code>, you should see:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Formula</span> <span class="n">New_Channel</span> <span class="n">Added</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="mi">2018</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">01</span><span class="n">_INT_BOLOGNA_RELEASE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">device</span> <span class="n">SCK73FD</span>

<p>And if we list the columns in the device, we should see:</p>
