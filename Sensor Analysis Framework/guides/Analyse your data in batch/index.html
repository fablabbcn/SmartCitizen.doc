                  <h1>Analyse your data in batch</h1>
                
                <p>Sometimes we have a lot of devices to process, and the interfaces for analysis in <a href="https://smartcitizen.me">smartcitizen.me</a> or in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">jupyter</span> <span class="n">notebook</span></code> might not be the most efficient way to do it. For this reason, we have developed a functionality to process the data in batches, defining the tasks to perform in a <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">json</span></code> descriptor file.</p>
<p>The descriptor file can be placed in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">src</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">tasks</span></code> directory. An example of how to run it is shown in <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">notebooks</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">batch_analysis</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ipynb</span></code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Load the object</span>

</pre></div>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality<a class="headerlink" href="#functionality" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>These tasks are intended to automatise data analysis tasks as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load, process and export processed data</li>
<li>Generate models and apply them, extracting metrics and comparing if they extrapolate to different set of sensors in different datasets, without having to run extra code</li>
<li>Make plots for different metrics in an automatic way, and export their renders</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow<a class="headerlink" href="#workflow" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>

<h2 id="json-task-description">Json task description<a class="headerlink" href="#json-task-description" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The descriptor file loaded is a <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">json</span></code> containing keys for each task to be run. Several tasks can be included and will be run consecutively:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="err">{</span>
    <span class="ss">&quot;TASK_1&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="ss">&quot;TASK_3&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="p">...</span><span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Each of the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">tasks</span></code> contains different fields, depending on what the process is.</p>
