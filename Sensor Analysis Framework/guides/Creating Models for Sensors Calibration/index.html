<p>In this section, we will detail how to develop models for our sensors. We will try two different approaches for model calibration:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)</strong>: based on the <a href="http://www.statsmodels.org/stable">statsmodels package</a>, the model is able to ingest an expression referring to the kit's available data and perform OLS regression over the defined training and test data</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning (LSTM)</strong>: based on the <a href="https://keras.io/">keras package</a> using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">tensorflow</a> in the backend. This framework can be used to train larger collections of data, among others:<ul>
<li>Robust to noise</li>
<li>Learn non-linear relationships</li>
<li>Aware of temporal dependence</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>This output brings a lot of information. First, we find what the dependent variable is, in our case always <code class="codehilite"><span class="s1">&#39;REF&#39;</span></code>. The type of model used and some general information is shown below that.</p>
<p>More statistically important information is found in the rest of the output. Some key data:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>R-squared and adjusted R-squared</em>: this is our classic correlation coefficient or R<sup>2</sup>. The adjusted one aims to correct the model overfitting by the inclusion of too many variables, and for that introduces a penalty on the number of variables included</li>
<li>Below, we can find a summary of the <em>model coefficients</em> applied to all the variables and the P&gt;|t| term, which indicates the significance of the term introduced in the model</li>
<li><em>Model quality diagnostics</em> are also indicated. Kurtosis and skewness are metrics for determining the distribution of the residuals. They indicate how the residuals of the model resemble a normal distribution. Below, we will review more on diagnosis plots. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarque–Bera_test">Jarque Bera test</a> indicates if the residuals are normally distributed (the null hypothesis is a joint hypothesis of the skewness being zero and the excess kurtosis being zero), and a value of zero indicates that the data is normally distributed. If the Jarque Bera test is valid (in the case above it isn't), the Durbin Watson is applicable in order to check for autocorrelation of the residuals (meaning that the residuals of our model are related among themselves and that we haven't captured some characteristics of our data with the tested model).</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there is a warning at the bottom indicating that the condition number is large. It suggests we might have multicollinearity problems in our model, which means that some of the independent variables might be correlated among themselves and that they are probably not necessary.</p>
<p>Our function also depicts the results in a graphical way for us to see the model itself. It will show the training and test datasets (as <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Reference</span> <span class="n">Train</span></code> and <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Reference</span> <span class="n">Test</span></code> respectively), and the prediction results. The mean and absolute confidence intervals for 95% confidence are also shown:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/M9TBeBT.png" /></p>
<p>Now we can look at some other model quality plots. If we run the cell below, we will obtain an adaptation of the summary plots from <strong>R</strong>:</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Let's review the output step by step:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Residual vs Fitted</strong> and <strong>Scale Location plot</strong>: these plots represents the model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity">heteroscedasticity </a>, which is a representation of the residuals versus the fitted values. This plot is helpful to check if the errors are distributed homogeneously and that we are not penalising high, low, or other values. There is also a red line which represents the average trend of this distribution which, we want it to be horizontal. For more information visit <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/76226/interpreting-the-residuals-vs-fitted-values-plot-for-verifying-the-assumptions">here</a> and <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52089/what-does-having-constant-variance-in-a-linear-regression-model-mean/52107#52107">here</a>. Clearly, in this model we are missing something:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QR2Ya4r.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Normal QQ</strong>: the qq-plot is a representation of the kurtosis and skewness of the residuals distribution. If the data were well described by a normal distribution, the values should be about the same, i.e.: on the diagonal (red line). For example, in our case the model presents a deviation on both tails, indicating skewness. In general, a simple rubric to interpret a qq-plot is that if a given tail twists off counterclockwise from the reference line, there is more data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal, and if a tail twists off clockwise there is less data in that tail of your distribution than in a theoretical normal. In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>if both tails twist counterclockwise we have heavy tails (leptokurtosis),</li>
<li>if both tails twist clockwise, we have light tails (platykurtosis),</li>
<li>if the right tail twists counterclockwise and the left tail twists clockwise, we have right skew</li>
<li>if the left tail twists counterclockwise and the right tail twists clockwise, we have left skew</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src ="https://i.imgur.com/4ldXI80.png" alt="QQ-plot" class="cover"/>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Residuals vs Leverage</strong>: this plot is probably the most complex of them all. It shows how much leverage one single point has on the whole regression. It can be interpreted as how the average line that passes through all the data (that we are calculating with the OLS) can be modified by 'far' points in the distribution, for example, outliers. This leverage can be seen as how much a single point is able to pull down or up the average line. One way to think about whether or not the results are driven by a given data point is to calculate how far the predicted values for your data would move if your model were fit without the data point in question. This calculated total distance is called Cook's distance. We can have four cases (more information from source, <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/58141/interpreting-plot-lm#65864">here</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>everything is fine (the best)</li>
<li>high-leverage, but low-standardized residual point</li>
<li>low-leverage, but high-standardized residual point</li>
<li>high-leverage, high-standardized residual point (the worst)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src ="https://i.imgur.com/BXsS6tE.png" alt="Cook Distance Plot" class="cover"/>
</div>

<p>In this case, we see that our model has some points with higher leverage but low residuals (probably not too bad) and that the higher residuals are found with low leverage, which means that our model is safe to outliers. If we run this function without the filtering, some outliers will be present and the plot turns into:</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src ="https://i.imgur.com/NQLA4lw.png" alt="Cook Distance Plot" class="cover"/>

<p>As we have seen in the <a href="https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework/Low%20Cost%20Sensors%20Calibration/">the calibration section</a>, machine learning algorithms promise a better representation of the sensor's data, being able to learn robust non-linear models and sequential dependencies. For that reason, we have implemented toolset based on <a href="https://keras.io/">keras</a> with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> backend, in order to train sequential models <sup id="fnref:third"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:third">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The workflow for a supervised learning algorithm reads as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reframe the data as a supervised learning algorithm and split into training and test dataframe. More information can be found <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/convert-time-series-supervised-learning-problem-python/">here</a></li>
<li>Define Model and fit for training dataset</li>
<li>Evaluate test dataframe and extract metrics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="model-comparison">Model comparison<a class="headerlink" href="#model-comparison" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Here is a visual comparison of both models:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/56eVx5P.png" /></p>
<p>It is very difficult though, to know which one is performing better. Let's then evaluate and compare our models. In order to evaluate it's metrics, we will be using the following principles<sup id="fnref:first"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:second"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:second">2</a></sup>:</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>In all of the expressions below, the letter <em>m</em> indicates the model field, <em>r</em> indicates the reference field. Overbar is average and <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma</script></span> is the standard deviation.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Linear correlation Coefficient</strong>
A measure of the agreement between two signals:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
R = {{1 \over N} \sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\overline m)( r_n-\overline r ) \over \sigma_m\sigma_r}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
R = {{1 \over N} \sum_{i=0}^n (m_n-\overline m)( r_n-\overline r ) \over \sigma_m\sigma_r}
</script>
</div>
<p>The correlation coefficient is bounded by the range <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">-1 \le R \le 1</span><script type="math/tex">-1 \le R \le 1</script></span>. However, it is difficult to discern information about the differences in amplitude between two signals from R alone.</p>
<p><strong>Normalized standard deviation</strong>
A measure of the differences in amplitude between two signals:
$$
\sigma * = {\sigma_m \over \sigma_r}
$$</p>
<p><strong><em>unbiased</em> Root-Mean-Square Difference</strong>
A measure of how close the modelled points fall to teach other:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RMSD' = \Bigl( {1 \over N} \sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \overline m)-(r_n - \overline r)]^2  \Bigr)^{0.5}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RMSD' = \Bigl( {1 \over N} \sum_{n=1}^N [(m_n - \overline m)-(r_n - \overline r)]^2  \Bigr)^{0.5}
</script>
</div>
<p><strong>Potential Bias</strong>
Difference between the means of two fields:
$$
B = \overline m - \overline r
$$
<strong>Total RMSD</strong>
A measure of the average magnitude of difference:
$$
RMSD = \Bigl( {1 \over N} \sum_{n=1}^N (m_n - r_n)^2  \Bigr)^{0.5}
$$</p>
<p>In other words, the unbiased RMSD (RMSD') is equal to the total RMSD if there is no bias between the model and the reference fields (i.e. B = 0). The relationship between both reads:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RMSD^2 = B^2 + RMSD'^2
</script>
</div>
<p>In contrast, the unbiased RMSD may be conceptualized as an overall measure of the agreement between the aplitude (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma</script></span>) and phase (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\phi</span><script type="math/tex">\phi</script></span>) of two temporal patterns. For this reason, the correlation coefficient (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">R</span><script type="math/tex">R</script></span>), normalised standard deviation (<span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma*</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma*</script></span>), and unbiased RMSD are all referred to as <strong>patern statistics</strong>, related to one another by:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RMSD'^2 = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_m^2 - 2\sigma_r\sigma_mR
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RMSD'^2 = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_m^2 - 2\sigma_r\sigma_mR
</script>
</div>
<p><strong>Normalized and unbiased RMSD</strong>
If we recast in standard deviation normalized units (indicated by the asterisk) it becomes:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RMSD'^* = \sqrt { 1 + \sigma*^2 - 2\sigma*R}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RMSD'^* = \sqrt { 1 + \sigma*^2 - 2\sigma*R}
</script>
</div>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: the minimum of this function occurrs when <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma* = R</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma* = R</script></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Normalized bias</strong>
Gives information about the mean difference but normalized by the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma*</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma*</script></span>
$$
B* = {\overline m - \overline r \over \sigma_r}
$$</p>
<p><strong>Target diagrams</strong>
The target diagram is a plot that provides summary information about the <strong>pattern statistics as well as the bias</strong> thus yielding an overview of their respective contributions to the total RMSD. In a simple Cartesian coordinate system, the unbiased RMSD may serve as the X-axis and the bias may serve as the Y-axis. The distance between the origin and the model versus observation statistics (any point, s, within the X,Y Cartesian space) is then equal to the total RMSD. If all is normalized by the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma_r</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma_r</script></span>, the distance from the origin is again the <em>standard deviation normalized total RMSD</em>:<sup id="fnref2:first"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first">1</a></sup></p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
RMSD^{*2} = B^{*2}+RMSD^{*'2}
</script>
</div>
<p>The resulting target diagram then provides information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>whether the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma_m</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma_m</script></span> is larger or smaller thann the <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">\sigma_r</span><script type="math/tex">\sigma_r</script></span></li>
<li>whether there is a positive or negative bias</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src ="https://i.imgur.com/x8NY4kD.png">
</div>

<p><em>Image Source: Jolliff et al. <sup id="fnref3:first"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p>Any point greater than RMSD*=1 is to be considered a poor performer since it doesn't offer improvement over the time series average.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the target diagram has no information about the correlation coefficient R, but some can be inferred, knowing that all the points within the RMSD* &lt;1 are positively correlated (R&gt;0), although, in <sup id="fnref4:first"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:first">1</a></sup> it is shown that a circle marker with radius <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">M_{R1}</span><script type="math/tex">M_{R1}</script></span>, means that all the points between that marker and the origin have a R coefficient larger than R1, where:</p>
<div>
<div class="MathJax_Preview">
M_{R1} = min(RMSD*') = \sqrt {1+R1^2-2R1^2}
</div>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
M_{R1} = min(RMSD*') = \sqrt {1+R1^2-2R1^2}
</script>
</div>

<p>Output:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/PBuBOpw.png" /></p>
<p>Here, every point that falls inside the yellow circle, will have an R<sup>2</sup> over 0.7, and so will be the red and green for R<sup>2</sup> over 0.5 and 0.9 respectively. We see that only one of our models performs well in that sense, which is the training dataset of the OLS. However, this dataset performs pretty badly in the test dataset, being the LSTM options much better. This target diagram offers information about how the hyperparameters affect our networks. For instance, increasing the training epochs from 100 to 200 does not affect greatly on model performance, but the effect of filtering the data beforehand to reduce the noise shows a much better model performance in both, training and test dataframe.</p>
