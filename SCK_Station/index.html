<p>The Smart Citizen Kit is the core of what we call the Smart Citizen System: a complete set of <strong>modular hardware components</strong> aiming to provide tools for <strong>environmental monitoring</strong>, ranging from <strong>citizen science</strong> and <strong>educational activities</strong> to more <strong>advanced scientific research</strong>. The system is designed in a extendable way, with a central data logger (the <a href="/Components/Data Board">Data Board</a>) with network connectivity to which the different components are branched. The system is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated <a href="/Sensor Platform">Storage platform</a> and a <a href="/Sensor Analysis Framework">Sensor analysis framework</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, the system is meant to serve as a <strong>base solution for more complex settings</strong>, not only related with air quality monitoring. For that purpose, in addition to the <a href="/Components/Urban Board">Urban Board</a>, the system also provides off-the-shelf support for a wide variety of third party sensors, using the expansion bus as a common port. One example is what we call the <a href="/Smart Citizen Station">Smart Citizen Station</a>: a full solution for low cost air pollution monitoring.</p>

<p>The sensor comes mounted and almost ready to be used:</p>
<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47950999751_13e6e00f49_b.jpg" alt="SCK 2.1 How to start?"></p>
<p>The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) and we will be able to configure it by following the instructions at <a href="https://start.smartcitizen.me">start.smartcitizen.me</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/NhSNXJ8.png" /></p>
<p>After the configuration process, data will be available on the SmartCitizen platform. You can explore the data there or download it using the <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">CSV Download</span></code> option (guide <a href="/Sensor Platform/guides/Downloading the Data/">here</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/5NlWx6O.jpg" /></p>
<h2 id="power-management"><img alt="🔋" class="emojione" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.2.7/assets/svg/1f50b.svg" title=":battery:" /> Power management<a class="headerlink" href="#power-management" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<h3 id="battery-duration">Battery duration<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-duration" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The SCK comes with a 2000mAh LiPo battery. The battery is meant to be a complete power option for short-term measurements and a backup solution when the kit it is used for long periods. For long exposures, we recommend to permanently connect the USB to kit. The battery duration is dependent on which sensors are enabled or disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>All sensors publishing over Wi-Fi: 12 hrs.</li>
<li>All sensors publishing on SD card: 13 hrs.</li>
<li>Without air quality sensors over Wi-Fi: 10 days</li>
<li>Without air quality sensors on SD card: 25 days</li>
</ul>
<p>You will note that the kit <em>turns itself off</em> while operating on battery. Actually, this is what we call <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">sleep-mode</span></code>, an operation mode implemented to reduce consumption while on battery operation.</p>
<h3 id="battery-charging">Battery charging<a class="headerlink" href="#battery-charging" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The SCK has a micro USB port and can be charged like any Smartphone or Tablet using a dedicated adapter or a computer USB port.</p>
<p>We recommend using a tablet power adaptor, instead of a computer USB port, for quicker charging. Autonomy can be extended by using a Power Bank, or a 5V PV Panel.</p>
<h3 id="user-feedback">User feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#user-feedback" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The LED serves as an indication of the battery status. If the LED is flashing orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> it indicates that the battery must be charged. The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will change from orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.</p>

<p>The data board features a set of user interfaces which provide feedback to the user, as well as two buttons with different functionalities. The main RGB LED provides general feedback of the data board status. Additionally, two buttons are provided for user action. A hardware reset button, which forces a power cut to the board, and a power button, used to change the device's mode, turn on and off the device, and to perform a factory reset. You can see both buttons below:</p>

<p>If we want to leave the kit on the outside for a few days you will need to provide it with extra protection. Below you can see the well-known 3D printed enclosure (for versions without PM sensor):</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">A note about the enclosures</p>
<p>Previous versions of the Smart Citizen Kit, without the PMS5003 sensor, included a 3D printed enclosure that holds the Data Board and Urban Sensor Board, as well as the lithium batteries. The enclosure for the Smart Citizen Kit V2.1 is being developed at the moment. A significant redesign is taking place in order to improve its waterproofness and thermal properties. A temporary solution is shown below (build your own enclosure).</p>

<p>A prototype of the new enclosure:</p>
