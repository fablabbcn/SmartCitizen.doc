<p>Due to some issues with the waterproofness of the Living Lab Station, we have developed a solution to protect it from the rain. This solution is shown in the pictures below, and it's meant to solve these problems for the current version of the LLS. The newer version of the LLS has a simpler setup, already including such cover to protect it from the rain or sun radiation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/abJOKRa.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Beware of collisions</p>
<p>As you can see, the cover is a rugged piece and it's only meant for the current version of the station. Please, be careful and do not fit it in places where people could bump into it.</p>
</div>
<p>This is what you get in the package (except the wrench):</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Step by step</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have the 3D printed cover on the Smart Citizen Kit, it's time to remove it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need to remove the two top white layers (in the pictures we did it without them)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/4BRDnQO.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the threads in the already mounted t-slots. The distance between them is ~50mm</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/zRh2JJI.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/44Y2WjZ.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jn8XnVD.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the 4x flat spacer in the threads</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/a4NRjmz.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the cover on the station</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/v2CKMtr.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EqZDdzy.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the serrated spacers, with the serrated side on the outer part (they help to hold the station in place)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EOG8UvW.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the perforated steel stripe in one of the sides. Don't tight it too much, so that you have room to place it in the pole</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EOG8UvW.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/JJmuU7d.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the station in it's final location, and tighten it with the perforated steel stripes. Play with both sides, so that the stripes are tight on the pole</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/IKfu75D.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lkWg556.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="power-supply">Power supply<a class="headerlink" href="#power-supply" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The Station can be directly powered at 220-240V AC (Max. consumption with the AC supply is 5W). It can also be powered via USB, with a normal phone charger (5V and 750mA max). However, there is a bit to do in order to change it. Let's see how!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/S8cVo9z.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Batteries</p>
<p>The Living Lab Station has a higher consumption, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors.</p>
<p>That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.</p>
<p><em>For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Solar Panel</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months.</p>

<h4 id="the-station-does-not-respond">The station does not respond<a class="headerlink" href="#the-station-does-not-respond" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>If the station does not respond or does not work properly you can do two things:</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Reboot your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reboot your Station by pressing the reset button located under the sensors board as seen on the picture.
That will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device.
Press the <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">RESET</span></code> button for a second. The light will go off and on and the device will start again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/tAofJ0g.png" /></p>
<p>You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the station is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data and configuration except the time in case of being in <strong>SD mode</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Factory reset your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reset the Station to the default settings so you can register again your device. Press the main button for <strong>15 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
<p>After 5 seconds the light will go off and will go on again after 15 seconds. Then you can release the button and your device will be fully resetted as a brand new Station.</p>

<p>First of all, push the station button. Maybe it's simply off.</p>
<p>If this does not work, surely the station has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work.</p>
<p>We will know that it is charging when the LED emits <span class="led orange blink"></span> orange pulses and once the battery is charged it will emit green <span class = "led green blink"> </ span></p>

<h3 id="sensor-evaluation-campaign">Sensor Evaluation Campaign<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-evaluation-campaign" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Prior to sensor deployment for the intervention monitoring, some of the Living Lab Stations will be evaluated and compared against reference measurement under different conditions. They will be deployed in several cities among the iScape partners in order to <em>1.</em> develop models for sensor calibration under different climatic and pollutant exposure conditions and <em>2.</em> assess data quality. This campaign intends to evaluate the Living Lab Station before it's deployment, and trying to prevent concerns raised about data quality that other low-cost sensor platforms <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>. </p>
<p>This evaluation will focus on the <strong>real-world conditions calibration</strong>, under wide range of exposure and climatic conditions, rather than developing tests in controlled conditions, as prior studies show discrepancies in the accuracy resulting from evaluation in laboratory conditions, versus that of outdoor conditions <sup id="fnref2:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. The tests will be conducted by co-location of at least two stations per site with high-end sensors under the conditions indicated in <a href="/Living%20Lab%20Station/#test">the test section</a> below.</p>
<p>The duration of the tests will be of 2,5 months, with two location changes. This is a compromise between the indications given in <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for at least 3-months campaign and the availability of high-end sensors for the evaluation. Nevertheless, this campaign intends to cover a range of conditions by the deployment of the Living Lab Station in diverse conditions, not only climatic but also exposure-wise. The location changes will also intend to evaluate how well the sensors are able to adapt to these exposure and climatic changes <sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>. The data will be uploaded to the <a href="http://www.smartcitizen.me">SmartCitizen Platform</a> and will be analysed using the <a href="/Sensor%20Analysis%20Framework">Sensor Analysis Framework</a>. The results of this evaluation in terms of models will be uploaded to a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-models">repository</a> and will be implemented on the SmartCitizen Platform for on-the-fly sensor data processing. This processing aims to provide an open platform for sensor analysis using data analysis techniques, need which has been highlighted by <sup id="fnref3:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As well, as stated in <sup id="fnref4:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref2:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">10</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>, it is necessary to perform individual field calibration for low-cost sensors if measurements comparable to those of high-end solutions are targeted. However, this calibration might not always be feasible in a wide range of conditions, leading to non-generalised models which can perform badly out of the training datasets. This test campaign also aims to study this concern, with an evaluation for a cross calibration methodology, in which results from a limited subset of observations are applied to the complete dataset <sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup>. If successful, this would be set ground for the development of calibration strategies where the sensors are co-located with a high-end sensor and posteriorly deployed for citizen-science activities, or long term monitoring of the iScape Living Labs interventions, where high end sensors might not be available. This co-location could be performed in a recurrent manner, performing sequences of calibration-deployment-calibration, using merging calibrations as suggested in <sup id="fnref2:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">11</a></sup>.</p>
<p>As a summary, this field campaign aims to cover the following points:</p>
<ul>

<p class="admonition-title">Important Guidelines</p>
<p>Please, refer to the <a href="/Living%20Lab%20Station/#sensor-considerations">sensor considerations section</a> for general information about the sensors. As well, take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Avoid direct exposure to intense sunlight for long periods of time, since this can severely affect the measurements (direct sun or intense transients).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid locations where high temperature or humidity transients are present since the sensor response is affected by these rapid changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid locations with low air flow or with direct exposure to air conditioning exhausts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
