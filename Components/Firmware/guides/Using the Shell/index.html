<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>This guide is a work in progress!</p>
</div>
<p>The SCK (from V2.0 onwards) has an integrated command shell over USB to manage all the kits functionalities for advanced users. In this guide, we will cover how to access to this functionality in different platforms, and some examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-it" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>We could define the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">shell</span></code> as a text-based interface to access almost any SCK functionality. In terms of hardware, it relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">serial communication</a> between the SCK and your computer, so any <strong>decent</strong> USB cable connected between them will do.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-access-it">How to access it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-access-it" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Software-wise, different platforms will have different interfaces. The easiest and most reliable for all of them would be through the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Using the Arduino IDE</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the <em>Arduino IDE</em> and select the port under <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Tools</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">Port</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span></code>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XEZXoyy.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch the <code class="codehilite"><span class="nb">Serial</span> <span class="n">Monitor</span></code> under <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">Tools</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">Serial</span> <span class="n">Monitor</span></code>. Make sure that the dropdowns in the bottom are set as in the image below (<code class="codehilite"><span class="nv">Carriage</span> <span class="k">return</span></code> and <code class="codehilite"><span class="mi">115200</span> <span class="n">baud</span></code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">help</span></code> to get started.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/iSONfFB.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>More advanced users would probably rather use a more <em>rugged</em> interface. In this case, you could use <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">screen</span></code> in your terminal of choice:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">ls</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cu</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">grep</span> <span class="n">usb</span>
<span class="n">cu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">usbmodem1411</span>
<span class="n">tty</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">usbmodem1411</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">screen</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">usmodem1411</span>
<span class="n">SCK</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you already installed <a href="https://platformio.org/">platformio</a> to <a href="/Components/Firmware/guides/Edit%20the%20Firmware/">edit the firmware</a> you can use it here, too</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">pio</span> <span class="n">device</span> <span class="n">monitor</span>
<span class="n">SCK</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Be patient!</p>
<p>The port will take a little time to appear in your list of devices. Normally the LED of your SCK will be <strong>static white</strong> during that period.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="some-examples">Some examples!<a class="headerlink" href="#some-examples" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">help</span></code> command outputs a quite intuitive explanation of all the commands:</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Pro tip</p>
<p>The SCK outputs  a lot of information via serial. This can be sometimes confusing while typing commands. You can silent it a bit with this command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SCK</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">shell</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="k">on</span>
<span class="n">Shell</span> <span class="k">mode</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="k">on</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will turn your LED static yellow, and no output except responses to your commands will be given. </p>
<p>Remember to turn it off after you are done experimenting!</p>

<p>Something cool to do with the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">monitor</span></code>, is to log the sensor output into a file for later analysis. For instance, in your terminal you could do:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Making most of the digital microphone</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The digital microphone in your SCK uses an FFT algorithm to calculate the final sound pressure level (SPL) in different scales (A, C, Z). The FFT spectrum is also available for user analysis. Let's have a look!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, enable it with:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SCK</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">sensor</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">enable</span> <span class="n">fft</span>
<span class="n">Enabling</span> <span class="n">Noise</span> <span class="n">FFT</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Then, monitor and log it in a file with:</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">echo</span> <span class="ss">&quot;monitor fft&quot;</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">usbmodem1411</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">screen</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">L</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">cu</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">usbmodem1411</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>In this file, we will have something like:</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">12</span>
<span class="mi">15</span>
<span class="mi">19</span>

<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The values between the dates are the actual FFT spectrum. We will now clean the lines with the dates and then plot the data. For this, we will use a <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">python</span></code> code to make things easier. You can download the code <a href="/assets/examples/spectrum_example.py">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we run this code in <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">python3</span></code> in the same folder where the screenlog from before is:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">spectrum_example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
</pre></div>

<p>We will have two outputs: a <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">csv</span></code> file with the spectrums in rows, and a png image that looks like this!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/KZfFDam.png" /></p>
<p>You can see that we were playing with a <a href="http://onlinetonegenerator.com/">tone generator</a> to make some high pitch noises at 10kHz and 20kHz. </p>
