<p>Sometimes (many times actually), our code won't do what we want it to do and we need to take a look at what it's doing. By using a <strong>debugger</strong> we will be able to see what is going on <em>inside</em> another program while it executes or even crashes. This is fairly straight forward when you code for a modern day computer, since most IDEs have a proper interface integrated for it. However, debugging a chip like the <em>SAMD21</em> can sometimes be tricky and here is where it's interesting to use a debugging kit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png" /></p>
<p><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">XKCD</a></em></p>
<p>To keep it simple: our final target is to be able to <strong>interact</strong> with the SAMD21 (or the chip) <strong>while it's executing the program</strong> and tell it to pause the execution, give us the value of some variables and then continue. We will release a fairly extensive report with documentation on this process, but for those interested in reading an overview on how to debug, this post can be a short introduction.</p>
<p>So, here we go! The first item we need is the <a href="http://openocd.org/"><strong>Open On-Chip Debugger</strong> (OpenOCD)</a> which provides debugging with the assistance of a <strong>debug adapter</strong>. This adapter is a small hardware module which helps provide the right kind of electrical signaling to the target being debugged. These are required since the debug host, on which OpenOCD runs (i.e. your computer, a Raspberry PI...) won’t usually have native support for such signaling, or the connector needed to hook up to the target.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/qJ2fV3N.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>Image Credit: Smart Citizen</em></p>
<p>These adapters are sometimes packaged as discrete dongles, which may generically be called <strong>hardware interface dongles</strong> (and are quite expensive). Some development boards also integrate them directly, which may let the development board connect directly to the debug host over USB (and sometimes also to power it over USB, like the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-zero">Arduino Genuino Zero</a>). In the case of the <strong>Smart Smart Citizen Kit</strong>, we have a <strong>SWD</strong> Adapter that supports <em>Serial Wire Debug</em> signaling to communicate with the <em>ARM core</em>. In our approach, <strong>using a complete open toolchain</strong>, OpenOCD is be running on a Raspberry Pi, and communicating with the SCK's SWD through the GPIO pins of the Pi.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Finally, to be able to actually <strong>see what is going on inside our firmware while it executes</strong>, we need something that is able to read and understand the machine code and hand it over to a human understandable interface. This is where <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/"><strong>GDB</strong></a> kicks in and helps us by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting our program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.</li>
<li>Make our program stop on specified conditions.</li>
<li>Examine what has happened when our program has stopped.</li>
<li>Change things in our program, so we can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</li>
</ul>
<p>GDB and OpenOCD will be running in a Raspberry Pi hooked up to the SWD interface of the SCK, and we will see what's going on in them from our computer's terminal via SSH. Fairly <em>simple</em>, right? Now, we can make some changes to our code, make GDB flash it to the SCK and keep debugging in a completely open toolchain!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>First download and copy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Lite</a> to your SDcard, here are the installation <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">docs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add wifi configuration</p>
<p>Create a file name <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">wpa_supplicant</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">conf</span></code> on the <code class="codehilite"><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">boot</span></code> partition of the SD card, the content of this file should looks like this:</p>
<p>```shell=
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1</p>
<p>network={
    ssid="wifi_ssid"
    psk="wifi_password"
}
```
Replacing wifi_ssid and wifi_password with your actual wifi network     information. The wpa_supplicant.conf file will be copied to /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory automatically once the Raspberry Pi is booted up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable SSH server.</p>
<p>SSH access is disabled as default for security reasons. To enable the SSH server when Raspberry Pi is booted up for the first time: create a file called <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">ssh</span></code> with no file extension and no contents, and copy it to the <code class="codehilite"><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">boot</span></code> partition on the SD card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find your raspberry on the network</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to find a raspberry pi over the network we can use commands like these:</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong>
```shell=
MY_IP_RANGE=$(ip addr | grep 'state UP' -A2 | tail -n1 | awk '{print $2}') &amp;&amp; nmap -sn <span><span class="MathJax_Preview">MY_IP_RANGE &amp;&amp; IP=</span><script type="math/tex">MY_IP_RANGE && IP=</script></span>(arp -na | grep b8:27:eb | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}') &amp;&amp; ssh $IP;

</pre></div></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SSH login without password:</p>
<ul>
<li>Si nunca has generado RSA key: <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">keygen</span></code> sin poner nada en la passphrase.</li>
<li>Copiar la clave a la raspberry: <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">copy</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">~/</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">ssh</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">id_rsa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">pub</span> <span class="n">raspi</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">address</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Ya que esté lista la raspberry con conectarla debe bootear y conectarse sola a la red, el commando que esta arriba (<code class="codehilite"><span class="n">MY_IP</span><span class="p">...</span></code>) la localiza y hace ssh login.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are logged to your raspberry pi and connected to the internet, do a <strong>system upgrade</strong>:
```shell=
sudo apt-get install rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

<h3 id="general-description">General description<a class="headerlink" href="#general-description" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on “inside” another program while it executes—or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.</p>
<p>GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
* Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
* Make your program stop on specified conditions.
* Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
* Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</p>
