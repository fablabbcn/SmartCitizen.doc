The connector supports an independent I2C bus by default, but by software it can be configured to support other uses (GPIO, I2C and UART). It can supply power up to 750mA, and it can be enabled or disabled by software to save power.</p>

<p>The Smart Citizen Kit is designed with a modular approach in mind. This means that the <a href="/Components/Urban%20Sensor%20Board/">Urban Board</a> is only a selection of low cost sensors for air quality, but the hardware itself can be expanded for other use cases such as a more advanced air quality monitoring setup, soil monitoring, or water quality.
