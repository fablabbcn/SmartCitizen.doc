<h3 id="publishing-data-using-custom-devices">Publishing data using custom devices<a class="headerlink" href="#publishing-data-using-custom-devices" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The Smart Citizen Platform supports data from any sensor that has a
<strong>numerical digital output</strong>. The Smart Citizen API supports other devices to publish data to the platform by previously agreeing with the Smart Citizen terms and conditions.</p>
<p>For each device type, a new device blueprint needs to be created. <strong>A device blueprint defines the sensors and the metrics that your devices will have.</strong> This will include the hardware details of your sensors and the kind of data that will be published to the platform. Custom calibration formulas to be applied to the data when processed in the platform can be also added.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">How to do it?</p>
<p>Once a device blueprint is added to the platform, any user can create as many devices as needed and publish data to them following the standard Smart Citizen API. It is important to note that Device Blueprint currently cannot be created by users and should be requested by contacting <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The minimal Device Blueprint includes all the necessary data that a user might provide in order to create a <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#kits">Kit</a>. It is composed of <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#components">Components</a> and those can reuse existing <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#sensors">Sensors</a> and <a href="http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#measurements">Measurements</a> definitions. Sensors define the hardware or software component that records the data.  Measurements are descriptions of what sensors are recording. Blueprints can be shared across many devices or can be tailored per device in order to provide dedicated calibration formulas per individual sensor. This is achieved with the <em>Components</em> binding.</p>
<p>The following example shows a basic Device Blueprint in JSON. This is the minimum of information that a blueprint needs:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="err">{</span>
<span class="err">    “name”: “The Frog”,</span>
<span class="err">    “description”: “Custom Arduino Humidity Sensor”,</span>
<span class="err">    “slug”: “ms:0,5”,</span>
<span class="err">    “components”: [{</span>
<span class="err">        “map”: “hum”,</span>
<span class="err">        “equation”: “(125.0 / 65536.0 * x) + 7”,</span>
<span class="err">        “sensor”: {</span>
<span class="err">            “name”: “HPP828E031”,</span>
<span class="err">            “description”: “Humidity”,</span>
<span class="err">            “unit”: “%”,</span>
<span class="err">            “measurement”: {</span>
<span class="err">                “name”: “relative humidity”,</span>
<span class="err">                “description”: “Relative humidity is a measure...”</span>
<span class="err">            }</span>
<span class="err">        }</span>
<span class="err">    }]</span>
<span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The following examples expand the previous Device Blueprint with the complete data model:</p>

<p class="admonition-title">This is a WIP</p>
<p>This section is under heavy development. Thanks for your patience!</p>
</div>
<p>Implementation of other sensors goes through the modification of the <a href="/Components/Firmware/">Firmware</a>. This is an advanced user feature, and previous programming experience in C++ is necessary.</p>
<p>The workflow we normally follow for this goes like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find out if there is an already existing library for the desired sensor. Good places to look at are <a href="https://github.com/adafruit">Adafruit's repository</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun">Sparkfun's repository</a> or a global <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement this library in the firmware. The library needs certain functions to be valid. (More info soon!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the device needs to log the data on the platform, you can email us at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;">&#115;&#117;&#112;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#114;&#116;&#99;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#122;&#101;&#110;&#46;&#109;&#101;</a> with a request for a new device blueprint. However, it is easier to simply log the data in SD-card in this case, if the online recording is not fully mandatory.</p>
</li>
