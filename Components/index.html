<p>The project's sensor platform builds on the legacy of previous Smart Smart Citizen Kit generations to develop a new set of tools especially aimed at providing meaningful data insights on a low budget. The system is designed in a extendable way, with a central data logger with network connectivity to which the different components are branched. The system is based on the principle of reproducibility, also integrating non-hardware components such as a dedicated storage platform and a sensor analysis framework.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/qTh4CpB.jpg" /></p>
<p>We believe building modular and reusable hardware is critical towards optimizing the research and development effort. By increasing the technology readiness levels of existing technologies, we can drastically improve the project exploitation strategy.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The core system bases its sensing capabilities in widely reviewed low cost sensors, and aims to provide a solid framework for environmental monitoring activities. Each of the modules is shown in the Figure below:</p>
