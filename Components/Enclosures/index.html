                <p>If we want to leave the kit on the outside for a few days you will need to provide it with extra protection. Below you can see the well-known 3D printed enclosure (for versions without PM sensor):</p>

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">A note about the enclosures</p>
<p>Previous versions of the Smart Citizen Kit, without the PMS5003 sensor, included a 3D printed enclosure that holds the Data Board and Urban Sensor Board, as well as the lithium batteries. Different versions are available for the SCK 2.1, either with a <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Outdoor%20Cases%20V2.0-2.1/Milled%20HDPE">CNC'ed</a> version, or <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/tree/master/SmartCitizen%20Outdoor%20Cases%20V2.0-2.1/3D%20Printed%20Prototype">3D printed one</a>. Currently, there is no mass produced version at SEEED.</p>
</div>
<p>See the CNC'ed HDPE version:</p>

<p>Or the 3D printed one:</p>

<p>Keep in mind that casing is designed for short outdoor deployments. If you want a case for long exhibitions abroad, we will soon have a much more rugged enclosure ready!

<p class="admonition-title">Step by step</p>
<p><strong>First, you will need the two 3D printed clips. You can <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-enclosures/blob/master/SmartCitizen%20DIY%20Clips%20V2.0-2.1/3D%20Print%20Clips.stl">download the STL</a> file and print them easily on any RepRap or similar FDM printer. If you don't know how to find a 3D printer, you can look for your nearest <a href="https://www.fablabs.io/labs">Fab Lab</a> or use <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com/3dprint">3D Hubs</a>.</strong></p>

<p>1.Use scissors to cut an empty plastic bottle at about 12 cm from the top</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/heo8cwW.jpg" /></p>
<p>2.Use the rubber band to fix it using the bottle cap</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/CjKDBBl.jpg" /></p>
<p>3.Place the Kit inside and use the rubber band to hold it</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/8KzbAqV.jpg" /></p>
<p>4.You have now a simple enclosure to use your Kit outdoors for short measurement periods!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/IhGxV67.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>You can now install the sensor outdoors!</strong></p>
