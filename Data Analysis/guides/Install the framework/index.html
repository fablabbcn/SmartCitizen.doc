<p><em>Do you have already a Python environment you use for other work and you are worried about updating some packages?</em></p>
<p><strong>Conda</strong> can load a dedicated environment for you to run <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jupyter</strong> based on the <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">environment</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span></code> configuration file we provide.</p>
<p>Open your favourite shell on the directory you have your project. <em>(<code class="codehilite"><span class="n">cmd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">exe</span></code> on windows)</em></p>
<p>Run the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This will install and load the Python environment we prepared for iSCAPE</p>
<p><code class="codehilite"><span class="n">conda</span> <span class="n">env</span> <span class="k">create</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">f</span> <span class="n">environment</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now activate the environment</p>
<p><code class="codehilite"><span class="k">source</span> <span class="n">activate</span> <span class="n">iscape</span></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ready, run to run Jupyter</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>If you do not want to install <strong>Anaconda</strong> you can install all the dependencies manually. Just follow the steps above:</p>
<h4 id="install-python">Install Python<a class="headerlink" href="#install-python" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Python is the main programming language we will use for Data Analysis.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows download and run the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">installer</a> for Python 2.7</li>
<li>Mac cames directly with python built in. However you can install the latest version using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Hombrew</a> and then run <code class="codehilite">$ brew install python</code></li>
<li>On Linux simply use your distribution package manager like <code class="codehilite">$ apt</code> in Debian or Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="install-pip">Install Pip<a class="headerlink" href="#install-pip" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Pip is the packet manager Python uses and it comes installed by default. If you have any issues you can download pip <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="installl-jupyter">Installl Jupyter<a class="headerlink" href="#installl-jupyter" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Jupyter Notebooks allows us to quickly learn, develop and improve our tools by providing a common convenient framework and UI.</p>
<p>Simply run <code class="codehilite"><span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">jupyter</span></code> on your terminal to install it.</p>
