<p>The Smart Citizen Station was born with the idea to provide the iScape Living Labs with a system for monitoring the performance of their interventions. The Station aims at providing a solution that can be used by the Living Labs not just from a scientific point of view but also as a tool to engage local communities on air pollution related issues.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/QB5P4r9.jpg" /></p>
<p>The station is designed with a modular principle where sensors can be added easily added expanding the capabilities of the installation or replaced when they are damaged or the sensors lifetime is over. From a costs perspective while being more expensive than the Smart Citizen Kit it is also conceived as a low-cost solution.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/p9lDxiv.jpg" /></p>
<p>The design builds on top of the Smart Citizen Kit adding an extra set of more accurate sensors especially aimed at measuring air pollutants. The sensors include the Gas Sensor Board, featuring EC Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone sensors and the PM Sensor Board, featuring a PM 2.5 / PM 10 sensor.</p>
<p>With all the sensor together this Kit provides information on Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Noise Level, Ambient Light, Barometric Pressure, Particles Matter (PM 2.5 / 10),  Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone. The sensors are later described in detail in the document at the Sensor Components section.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>We keep track internally of all sensor deployments and it is very important not to swap the internal components between Station to avoid mismatchs on the calibration data.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">More info</p>
<p>Deployment considerations are listed <a href="/Smart Citizen Station Deployments/#iscape-living-lab-station-v2">here</a></p>
</div>
<h3 id="sensor-considerations">Sensor considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#sensor-considerations" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p><strong>Electrochemical sensor</strong></p>
<p>The electrochemical sensors <strong>need stabilisation time under the testing conditions</strong> they will be at. It is important to set and power the sensors with sufficient time (1-2 days) on the test environment for them to adapt. The newer the sensor, the more stabilisation time it requires. For this deployment, you will be receiving brand new sensors.</p>
<p>Humidity and temperature extremes will require of further sensor adaptation, in order to dry out or absorb the necessary humidity for their proper functioning.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Do not extract/attach the sensor capsule from the base board while powered, this could irreversibly damage the sensor.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Particle Sensor</strong></p>
<p>The particle sensors measurements are delivered as averages of the two sensors with periodic validity checks. We are currently developing one-shot strategies for battery life improvement, but in the meantime, please make sure the sensor has reliable energy supply if you will use these sensors permanently.</p>
<h2 id="power">Power<a class="headerlink" href="#power" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The kit has a battery life of 12 hours as is intended as a backup solution only. That's why a power supply needs to be installed as decribed below.</p>
<p>When we no longer want to publish or save more data for a few days we can turn off the kit. To do this, press the button for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>If the colors of the LED appear orange <span class="led small orange"> </span> indicates that the battery must be charged.</p>
<p>The battery takes about 4 hours to fully charge. When the battery is fully charged, change the orange to green <span class="led small green"> </span>.</p>
<p><em>Remember that in addition to the colors you will have the state color of the kit: configuration, network and sd.</em></p>
<h3 id="power-supply">Power supply<a class="headerlink" href="#power-supply" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The Station can be directly powered at 220V AC (max consumption 5W).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Batteries</p>
<p>The Smart Citizen Station has a higher consumption than the kit, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors.</p>
<p>That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.</p>
<p><em>For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Solar Panel</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months.</p>
