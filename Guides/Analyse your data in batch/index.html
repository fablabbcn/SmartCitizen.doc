                  <h1>Analyse your data in batch</h1>
                
                <p>Sometimes we have a lot of devices to process, and the interfaces for analysis in <a href="https://smartcitizen.me">smartcitizen.me</a> or in the <code>jupyter notebook</code> might not be the most efficient way to do it. For this reason, we have developed a functionality to process the data in batches, defining the tasks to perform in a <code>json</code> descriptor file.</p>
<p>The descriptor file can be placed in the <code>src/tasks</code> directory (or any, actually). An example of how to run it is shown in <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data/blob/master/examples/batch_analysis.ipynb"><code>examples/batch_analysis.ipynb</code></a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Load the object
from src.models.batch import batch_analysis&quot;,
tasks_file = &#39;../tasks/batch.json&#39;&quot;,
batch_session = batch_analysis(tasks_file, verbose = True)

# Run the analysis
batch_session.run()
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="functionality">Functionality<a class="headerlink" href="#functionality" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>These tasks are intended to automatise data analysis tasks as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load, process and export processed data</li>
<li>Generate models and apply them, extracting metrics and comparing if they extrapolate to different set of sensors in different datasets, without having to run extra code</li>
<li>Make plots for different metrics in an automatic way, and export their renders</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="json-task-description">Json task description<a class="headerlink" href="#json-task-description" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The descriptor file loaded is a <code>json</code> containing keys for each task to be run. Several tasks can be included and will be run consecutively:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>{
    &quot;TASK_1&quot;:{...},
    &quot;TASK_2&quot;:{...},
    &quot;TASK_3&quot;:{...}
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Each of the <code>tasks</code> contains different fields, depending on what the process is.</p>

<p>In case <strong>no model needs to be calculated</strong>, the data can be specified directly in the task:</p>

<!-- ### Pre-process data

Different preprocessing options can be defined. The most common one, for the sensors in the _Smart Citizen Project_ are the analysis of the _electrochemical sensors_ but others can be used and implemented, for later call from `/src/models/batch.py`.

**Note**: this section is currently project specific for electrochemical sensors defined [here](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors)

- `baseline_method`: baseline method used to calculate pollutant concentration, as defined in [the documentation](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#sensor-calibration). It can be `deltas` or `als`, using the methodology described in [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.024) for `deltas` or [here](https://zanran_storage.s3.amazonaws.com/www.science.uva.nl/ContentPages/443199618.pdf) for the Asymmetric Least Squares Smoothing (ALS). 
- `parameters`: parameters for the baseline determination:
    + in case of `deltas` method, is a `list` with [`min_delta`, `max_delta`, `interval`]
    + in case of `als` method, is another `dict` containing `lambda` and `p` parameters
- `methods`: a dict containing which method to use for each pollutant calculation (see example above). options for the calculation are `classic` from Alphasense Ltd. recommendations, or `baseline`, using the `baseline_method` specified before. Each of them can use different baselines (`single_aux`, `single_temp` or `single_hum`). -->

<p>This description is suitable for timeseries plots. Check below for other types:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/p6qogrD.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><code>plot_type</code>: the plot type to be used. Currently we support <code>timeseries</code>, <code>violin</code>, <code>scatter_matrix</code>, <code>correlation_plot</code>, <code>heatmap</code>, <code>barplot</code>, <code>coherence_plot</code></li>
<li><code>plotting_library</code>: <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>plotly</code></li>
<li><code>data</code>: the data to represent. This data has to be loaded previously. This is only to define the plot:<ul>
<li><code>test</code>: each plot can only represent data from a single <code>test</code></li>
<li><code>traces</code>: numbered entries to specify the <code>device</code>, <code>channel</code> and, if applicable, the subplot (only for timeseries)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Same plot for many devices?</p>
<p>Set "<code>device</code>: 'all'" and  <code>"separate_device_plots": true</code>, and we will make separate plots for each device.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><code>options</code>: <ul>
<li><code>show_plot</code>: whether or not to show the plot. Not recommended for large amounts</li>
<li><code>separate_device_plots</code>: <code>true</code> in case we want a single plot for each device in <code>traces: devices</code>. <code>false</code> in case we want to merge all the devices in a single plot (for comparison purposes). Applicable for timeseries</li>
<li><code>target_raster</code>: the frequency of the data to plot. Reduces processing time</li>
<li><code>min_date</code>, <code>max_date</code>: if not <code>null</code>, they crop the data with those dates</li>
<li><code>export_path</code>: where to put the plot. If <code>null</code>, we won't export anything</li>
<li><code>file_name</code>: how to name the plot. We will append the trace name in case <code>separate_device_plots</code> is set to <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>formatting</code>: <ul>
<li><code>xlabel</code>: Name to tag the x axis of the plot</li>
<li><code>ylabel</code>: Name to tag the y axis(es) of the plot. It can be more than one value in a <code>json</code> style</li>
<li><code>yrange</code>: Range fro the y axis(es). Same as above</li>
<li><code>title</code>: plot title</li>
<li><code>grid</code>: to show the grid or not</li>
<li><code>height</code>, <code>width</code>: plot height and width</li>
</ul>
