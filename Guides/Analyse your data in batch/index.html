For this reason, we have developed a functionality to process the data in batches, defining the tasks to perform in a <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">json</span></code> descriptor file.</p>
<p>The descriptor file can be placed in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">src/tasks</span></code> directory (or any, actually). An example of how to run it is shown in <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data/blob/master/examples/batch_analysis.ipynb"><code class="codehilite"><span class="err">examples/batch_analysis.ipynb</span></code></a>:</p>

<p>These tasks are intended to automatise data analysis tasks as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load, process and export processed data</li>
<li>Generate models and apply them, extracting metrics and comparing if they extrapolate to different set of sensors in different datasets, without having to run extra code</li>
<li>Make plots for different metrics in an automatic way, and export their renders</li>

Different preprocessing options can be defined. The most common one, for the sensors in the _Smart Citizen Project_ are the analysis of the _electrochemical sensors_ but others can be used and implemented, for later call from `/src/models/batch.py`.

**Note**: this section is currently project specific for electrochemical sensors defined [here](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors)

- `baseline_method`: baseline method used to calculate pollutant concentration, as defined in [the documentation](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Gas%20Pro%20Sensor%20Board/Electrochemical%20Sensors/#sensor-calibration). It can be `deltas` or `als`, using the methodology described in [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.10.024) for `deltas` or [here](https://zanran_storage.s3.amazonaws.com/www.science.uva.nl/ContentPages/443199618.pdf) for the Asymmetric Least Squares Smoothing (ALS). 
- `parameters`: parameters for the baseline determination:
    + in case of `deltas` method, is a `list` with [`min_delta`, `max_delta`, `interval`]
    + in case of `als` method, is another `dict` containing `lambda` and `p` parameters
- `methods`: a dict containing which method to use for each pollutant calculation (see example above). options for the calculation are `classic` from Alphasense Ltd. recommendations, or `baseline`, using the `baseline_method` specified before. Each of them can use different baselines (`single_aux`, `single_temp` or `single_hum`). -->
