<p>The <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">data</span></code> directory will be the place where we will organise our data. Each of the sub-directories is explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="err">export</span></code>: we will export processed data or images here</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="err">interim</span></code>: we will place files used internally for the framework, such as sensor calibration data</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="k">proc</span><span class="nb">es</span><span class="nv">sed</span></code>: the most important folder of our data directory. This will contain a hierarchy with the different tests after loading into our database. The tests in this folder will have an unified format to easily navigate them. It's the folder we will load our data from, once we have <a href="#Create a test">created a test</a>.</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="err">raw</span></code>: raw sdcard data can be placed here. It will feed our test creation script below</li>
<li><code class="codehilite"><span class="err">scripts</span></code>: a compilation of handy scripts to parse excel files, concatenate csvs and more</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-test">The test<a class="headerlink" href="#the-test" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>we will organise our data in tests. The concept is very simple. A test is a collection of devices (SCKs or not), that have a common purpose. They can be located in the same spot (co-location) or not, and the main idea is that we centralise the data in a common instance for easy analysis.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<image src="https://i.imgur.com/CSi5tL4.png" width="500px"/>
</div>

<p>Tests have dates, authors, can have comments (for us to remember what we did), a report attached and can be in different conditions (outdoor, indoor)... We will put all this metadata in a <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">yaml</span></code> file to help use look for the tests later on. </p>
<p>Tests can also have different sources. They could be csv files, xls files or data from the Smart Citizen API. For the local files, we will first pre-process them with the scripts in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">data/scripts</span></code> folder and then place them in the <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">data/raw</span></code> folder, in csv format. We use this format because it's a common usable format and, although it is not the most efficient way of archiving the data, it can be easily explored by other common applications.</p>
<h3 id="pre-process-the-sd-card-data">Pre-process the sd card data<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-process-the-sd-card-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In order to make our files usable, we will need to have them in a format like <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">YY-MM-DD.CSV</span></code>. However, if the kit has been reset, we can find some files like: <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">YY-MM-DD.01</span></code>, <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">YY-MM-DD.02</span></code> and they should be something like <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">YY-MM-DD_01.CSV</span></code>, <code class="codehilite"><span class="err">YY-MM-DD_02.CSV</span></code>...</p>
<div class="admonition info">

It contains basic references of the internal sensors that can be later on used in the different calibration files. An example of a Smart Citizen Station is shown below. Since the device can have different sensors at different times, the dates are also important.
