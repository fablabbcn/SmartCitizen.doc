<p class="admonition-title">Step by step</p>
<p>Go through the <a href="/Guides/Install the framework">installation guide</a> first before jumping into this guide.</p>
</div>
<p>When downloading the framework, the following folder structure is copied:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>├── environment.yml

</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>data</code> directory will be the place where we will organise our data. Each of the sub-directories is explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>export</code>: we will export processed data or images here</li>
<li><code>interim</code>: we will place files used internally for the framework, such as sensor calibration data</li>
<li><code>processed</code>: the most important folder of our data directory. This will contain a hierarchy with the different tests after loading into our database. The tests in this folder will have an unified format to easily navigate them. It's the folder we will load our data from, once we have <a href="#Create a test">created a test</a>.</li>
<li><code>raw</code>: raw sdcard data can be placed here. It will feed our test creation script below</li>
<li><code>scripts</code>: a compilation of handy scripts to parse excel files, concatenate csvs and more</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-test">The test<a class="headerlink" href="#the-test" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>we will organise our data in tests. The concept is very simple. A test is a collection of devices (SCKs or not), that have a common purpose. They can be located in the same spot (co-location) or not, and the main idea is that we centralise the data in a common instance for easy analysis.</p>
<div style="text-align:center">
<image src="https://i.imgur.com/CSi5tL4.png" width="500px"/>
</div>

<p>Tests have dates, authors, can have comments (for us to remember what we did), a report attached and can be in different conditions (outdoor, indoor)... We will put all this metadata in a <code>yaml</code> file to help use look for the tests later on. </p>
<p>Tests can also have different sources. They could be csv files, xls files or data from the Smart Citizen API. For the local files, we will first pre-process them with the scripts in the <code>data/scripts</code> folder and then place them in the <code>data/raw</code> folder, in csv format. We use this format because it's a common usable format and, although it is not the most efficient way of archiving the data, it can be easily explored by other common applications.</p>
<h3 id="pre-process-the-sd-card-data">Pre-process the sd card data<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-process-the-sd-card-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In order to make our files usable, we will need to have them in a format like <code>YY-MM-DD.CSV</code>. However, if the kit has been reset, we can find some files like: <code>YY-MM-DD.01</code>, <code>YY-MM-DD.02</code> and they should be something like <code>YY-MM-DD_01.CSV</code>, <code>YY-MM-DD_02.CSV</code>...</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Pro-tip</p>
<p>We can rename them manually, but if we have many of them, we can use this one-liner (works in oh-my-zsh):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>autoload -Uz zmv
zmv &#39;(*).(0*)&#39; &#39;$1_$2.CSV&#39;
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can now concatenate all the sd card data from a device with the <code>concat_script.py</code> in the <code>data/scripts</code> folder.</p>
<p>We can access the script's help by typing in the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(smartcitizen-data) ➜  scripts git:(master) ✗ python concat_script.py -h
usage: concat_script.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--index INDEX] [--keep]
                        [--ignore IGNORE] [--directory DIRECTORY]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        Output file name, including extension
  --index INDEX, -i INDEX
                        Final name of time index
  --keep, -k            Keep full CSV header
  --ignore IGNORE, -ig IGNORE
                        Ignore files in concatenation
  --directory DIRECTORY, -d DIRECTORY
                        Directory for csv files to concatenate
</code></pre></div>
<p>Create a directory (<code>FILES</code>) and put the sd card data of one device in it. Then, run the script with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(smartcitizen-data) ➜  scripts git:(master) ✗ python concat_script.py -k -d FILES

<p>We can find our concatenated file!</p>
<h3 id="create-a-test">Create a test<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-test" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Once we have all our concatenated files, we can proceed to create our test. For this, you can launch <code>jupyter lab</code> and open the <a href="https://github.com/fablabbcn/smartcitizen-iscape-data/blob/master/examples/test_creation.ipynb">examples/test_creation.ipynb</a> notebook.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>data.tests[testname].devices[device_name].readings
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can check the columns in it by:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>data.tests[testname].devices[device_name].readings.columns
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="export-data">Export data<a class="headerlink" href="#export-data" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Once we have concluded our analysis, we can export the process data. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Test name where the device is
testname = &#39;mytest&#39;
# List of devices to export
devices = list(data.tests[mytest].devices.keys())
# Example exporting only the first. We can iterate over devices with a for loop and export them all in separate CSV files
devicename = devices[0]
# Export it
data.export_data(testname, devicename, export_path = &#39;/path/to/folder&#39;, all_channels = True, forced_overwrite = True)s
</code></pre></div>
<p>Some options are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy to test folder: it will export the csv to the <code>/processed</code> folder in the test</li>
<li>Include All / Raw / Processed: Options to include all the channels in your test, or only the ones tagged as <code>raw</code> or <code>processed</code> from the descriptor file in: <code>data/interim/sensorNamesExport.json</code></li>
<li>Rename channels: if you want to rename channels with the descriptor file mentioned above</li>
</ul>
