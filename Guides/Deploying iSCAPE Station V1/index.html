<h4 id="umbrella-cover-installation">Umbrella cover installation<a class="headerlink" href="#umbrella-cover-installation" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Due to some issues with the waterproofness of the Living Lab Station, we have developed a solution to protect it from the rain. This solution is shown in the pictures below, and it's meant to solve these problems for the current version of the LLS. The newer version of the LLS has a simpler setup, already including such cover to protect it from the rain or sun radiation.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/abJOKRa.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Beware of collisions</p>
<p>As you can see, the cover is a rugged piece and it's only meant for the current version of the station. Please, be careful and do not fit it in places where people could bump into it.</p>
</div>
<p>This is what you get in the package (except the wrench):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ftZRoT6.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Step by step</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have the 3D printed cover on the Smart Citizen Kit, it's time to remove it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need to remove the two top white layers (in the pictures we did it without them)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/4BRDnQO.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the threads in the already mounted t-slots. The distance between them is ~50mm</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/zRh2JJI.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/44Y2WjZ.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/jn8XnVD.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert the 4x flat spacer in the threads</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/a4NRjmz.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the cover on the station</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/v2CKMtr.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EqZDdzy.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the serrated spacers, with the serrated side on the outer part (they help to hold the station in place)</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EOG8UvW.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the perforated steel stripe in one of the sides. Don't tight it too much, so that you have room to place it in the pole</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EOG8UvW.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/JJmuU7d.jpg" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put the station in it's final location, and tighten it with the perforated steel stripes. Play with both sides, so that the stripes are tight on the pole</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/IKfu75D.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/lkWg556.jpg" /></p>

<p>You are done!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="power-supply">Power supply<a class="headerlink" href="#power-supply" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The Station can be directly powered at 220-240V AC (Max. consumption with the AC supply is 5W). It can also be powered via USB, with a normal phone charger (5V and 750mA max). However, there is a bit to do in order to change it. Let's see how!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/S8cVo9z.jpg" /></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Batteries</p>
<p>The Living Lab Station has a higher consumption, mostly due to the fans on the two PM sensors.</p>
<p>That means the internal battery last just for 20h, and it is only aimed at providing backup power.</p>
<p><em>For example, we can connect the station on the street light electric line, so the Station gets charged during the night when the lights are on.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Solar Panel</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are having some problems with the PV Solar Panel system to power the Station independently. The system is currently under tests, and it will be available in the next few months.</p>

<h4 id="the-station-does-not-respond">The station does not respond<a class="headerlink" href="#the-station-does-not-respond" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>If the station does not respond or does not work properly you can do two things:</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Reboot your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reboot your Station by pressing the reset button located under the sensors board as seen on the picture.
That will not delete any configuration, it will simply restart your device.
Press the <code>RESET</code> button for a second. The light will go off and on and the device will start again.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/tAofJ0g.png" /></p>
<p>You can also perform a reboot by disconnecting the battery and the USB cable so that the station is restarted. In this way we will not lose any data and configuration except the time in case of being in <strong>SD mode</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Factory reset your Station</p>
<p>You can fully reset the Station to the default settings so you can register again your device. Press the main button for <strong>15 seconds</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uJ0JJIb.jpg" /></p>
<p>After 5 seconds the light will go off and will go on again after 15 seconds. Then you can release the button and your device will be fully resetted as a brand new Station.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="the-led-does-not-turn-on-and-the-station-does-not-work">The LED does not turn on and the station does not work<a class="headerlink" href="#the-led-does-not-turn-on-and-the-station-does-not-work" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>First of all, push the station button. Maybe it's simply off.</p>
<p>If this does not work, surely the station has been left without battery. You will have to charge it using the USB charger. Any other mobile charger will also work.</p>
<p>We will know that it is charging when the LED emits <span class="led orange blink"></span> orange pulses and once the battery is charged it will emit green <span class = "led green blink"> </ span></p>
<h4 id="the-station-does-not-store-the-data-on-the-sd-card">The station does not store the data on the SD card.<a class="headerlink" href="#the-station-does-not-store-the-data-on-the-sd-card" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Some SD cards may have problems over time. We can try <a href="">formatting it</a> but in case it does not work any micro SD card we buy at any mobile or computer store it will work. The size is not important and any micro SD or micro SDHC 512MB card up to 32GB will work.</p>
