<p>This guide is a work in progress!</p>
</div>
<p>The SCK (from V2.0 onwards) has an integrated command shell over USB to manage all the kits functionalities for advanced users. In this guide, we will cover how to access to this functionality in different platforms, and some examples.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-it" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>We could define the <code>shell</code> as a text-based interface to access almost any SCK functionality. In terms of hardware, it relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication">serial communication</a> between the SCK and your computer, so any <strong>decent</strong> USB cable connected between them will do.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-access-it">How to access it?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-access-it" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Software-wise, different platforms will have different interfaces. The easiest and most reliable for all of them would be through the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Using the Arduino IDE</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the <em>Arduino IDE</em> and select the port under <code>Tools &gt; Port &gt;</code>:</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XEZXoyy.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launch the <code>Serial Monitor</code> under <code>Tools &gt; Serial Monitor</code>. Make sure that the dropdowns in the bottom are set as in the image below (<code>Carriage return</code> and <code>115200 baud</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in <code>help</code> to get started.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/iSONfFB.png" /></p>
</div>
<p>More advanced users would probably rather use a more <em>rugged</em> interface. In this case, you could use <code>screen</code> in your terminal of choice:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&gt; ls /dev/cu | grep usb
cu.usbmodem1411
tty.usbmodem1411
&gt; screen /dev/cu.usmodem1411
SCK &gt;
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you already installed <a href="https://platformio.org/">platformio</a> to <a href="/Guides/Edit%20the%20Firmware/">edit the firmware</a> you can use it here, too</p>

<div class="admonition warning">

<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Pro tip</p>
<p>The SCK outputs  a lot of information via serial. This can be sometimes confusing while typing commands. You can silent it a bit with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; shell -on
Shell mode: on
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will turn your LED static yellow, and no output except responses to your commands will be given. </p>
<p>Remember to turn it off after you are done experimenting!</p>

<p>If you want to change your recording mode to, for instance, <code>sdcard</code> mode, you could do so by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; config -mode sdcard
</code></pre></div>

<p>To set it up in <code>network</code> mode:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; config -mode network -wifi &quot;SSID&quot; &quot;PASSWORD&quot; -token 123456

<div class="admonition warning">

<p>Note that the token is not between quotes since it's always 6 digits</p>

<p>To modify your wifi:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; config -wifi &quot;NEWSSID&quot; &quot;NEWPASSWORD&quot;

<h3 id="set-recording-and-publication-intervals">Set recording and publication intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#set-recording-and-publication-intervals" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In order to understand the reading and publication intervals, it is important to understand how the structure of the measurements is done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Overall reading interval: base period for the SCK to take a measurement</li>
<li>Individual sensor reading interval: period for each sensor to take a measurement. It is defined as N times the <em>Overall reading interval</em></li>
<li>Publication interval: time for the SCK to publish to the Smart Citizen Platform, independent of the reading interval.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of the sensors can be configured independently, with a reading interval N times the <em>overall reading interval</em>. For instance, after the <code>SAM firmware V0.9.7</code>, all the sensors are read every 60s except the PMS5003, which is read every 5 minutes or 5 times the reading interval. </p>
<p>In the case of the publication interval to the Smart Citizen Platform, the  default is 3 minutes. </p>
<p>All this can be configured using the shell interface. For instance, to set the publication interval to every 10 minutes, we could do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>config -pubint 600
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or to set the reading interval to every 3 minutes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>config -readint 180
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or both at 10 minutes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>config -pubint 600 -readint 600
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we want to configure one specific sensor, we can do so by typing the following, only remember, that it's rounded to the closest integer multiplier of the overall reading interval:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; sensor temp -interval 360
The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (360)
Changing interval of Temperature to 360
Saved configuration on eeprom!!
</code></pre></div>

<p>For instance, if we try to do 1.5 times the reading interval of the temperature sensor, we will get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SCK &gt; sensor temp -interval 90 
The sensor read interval is calculated as a multiple of general read interval (60)
Changing interval of Temperature to 60
Saved configuration on eeprom!!
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some <strong>limitations</strong> apply though:</p>
<ol>
<li>The minimum reading and publication interval is 30s</li>
<li>The maximum reading interval is one day</li>
<li>The maximum publication interval is one hour</li>
</ol>
