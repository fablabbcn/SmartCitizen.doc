                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes (many times actually), our code won't do what we want it to do and we need to take a look at what it's doing. By using a <strong>debugger</strong> we will be able to see what is going on <em>inside</em> another program while it executes or even crashes. This is fairly straight forward when you code for a modern day computer, since most IDEs have a proper interface integrated for it. However, debugging a chip like the <em>SAMD21</em> can sometimes be tricky and here is where it's interesting to use a debugging kit.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/fixing_problems.png" /></p>
<p>To keep it simple: our final target is to be able to <strong>interact</strong> with the SAMD21 (or the chip) <strong>while it's executing the program</strong> and tell it to pause the execution, give us the value of some variables and then continue. We will release a fairly extensive report with documentation on this process, but for those interested in reading an overview on how to debug, this post can be a short introduction.</p>
<p>So, here we go! The first item we need is the <a href="http://openocd.org/"><strong>Open On-Chip Debugger</strong> (OpenOCD)</a> which provides debugging with the assistance of a <strong>debug adapter</strong>. This adapter is a small hardware module which helps provide the right kind of electrical signaling to the target being debugged. These are required since the debug host, on which OpenOCD runs (i.e. your computer, a Raspberry PI...) won’t usually have native support for such signaling, or the connector needed to hook up to the target.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/qJ2fV3N.jpg" /></p>
<p>These adapters are sometimes packaged as discrete dongles, which may generically be called <strong>hardware interface dongles</strong> (and are quite expensive). Some development boards also integrate them directly, which may let the development board connect directly to the debug host over USB (and sometimes also to power it over USB, like the <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/genuino-zero">Arduino Genuino Zero</a>). In the case of the <strong>Smart Smart Citizen Kit</strong>, we have a <strong>SWD</strong> Adapter that supports <em>Serial Wire Debug</em> signaling to communicate with the <em>ARM core</em>. In our approach, <strong>using a complete open toolchain</strong>, OpenOCD is be running on a Raspberry Pi, and communicating with the SCK's SWD through the GPIO pins of the Pi.</p>
<p>Finally, to be able to actually <strong>see what is going on inside our firmware while it executes</strong>, we need something that is able to read and understand the machine code and hand it over to a human understandable interface. This is where <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/"><strong>GDB</strong></a> kicks in and helps us by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting our program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.</li>
<li>Make our program stop on specified conditions.</li>
<li>Examine what has happened when our program has stopped.</li>
<li>Change things in our program, so we can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</li>
</ul>
<p>GDB and OpenOCD will be running in a Raspberry Pi hooked up to the SWD interface of the SCK, and we will see what's going on in them from our computer's terminal via SSH. Fairly <em>simple</em>, right? Now, we can make some changes to our code, make GDB flash it to the SCK and keep debugging in a completely open toolchain!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>First download and copy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">Raspbian Lite</a> to your SDcard, here are the installation <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md">docs</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add wifi configuration</p>
<p>Create a file name <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> on the <code>/boot</code> partition of the SD card, the content of this file should looks like this:</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=&quot;wifi_ssid&quot;
    psk=&quot;wifi_password&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>
Replacing wifi_ssid and wifi_password with your actual wifi network     information. The wpa_supplicant.conf file will be copied to /etc/wpa_supplicant/ directory automatically once the Raspberry Pi is booted up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable SSH server.</p>
<p>SSH access is disabled as default for security reasons. To enable the SSH server when Raspberry Pi is booted up for the first time: create a file called <code>ssh</code> with no file extension and no contents, and copy it to the <code>/boot</code> partition on the SD card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find your raspberry on the network</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to find a raspberry pi over the network we can use commands like these:</p>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>MY_IP_RANGE=$(ip addr | grep &#39;state UP&#39; -A2 | tail -n1 | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;) &amp;&amp; nmap -sn $MY_IP_RANGE &amp;&amp; IP=$(arp -na | grep b8:27:eb | grep -Eo &#39;[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}&#39;) &amp;&amp; ssh $IP;
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Mac</strong> </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>MY_RANGE=$(ip addr | grep &quot;UP&quot; -A3 | grep &#39;192&#39; -A0 | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;) &amp;&amp; nmap -sn $MY_RANGE &amp;&amp; arp -na | grep b8:27:eb
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SSH login without password:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have never generated a RSA key: <code>ssh-keygen</code> without passphrase</li>
<li>Copy the key to the Raspberry: <code>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub raspi-address</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Once booted, it will connect to the network. The command above (<code>MY_IP...</code>) finds it and logs into it via SSH.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you are logged to your raspberry pi and connected to the internet, do a <strong>system upgrade</strong>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install rpi-update
sudo rpi-update
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
</code></pre></div>
Install some <strong>dependencies</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool make pkg-config libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev telnet sshfs
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="openocd-installation">Openocd installation<a class="headerlink" href="#openocd-installation" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clone <strong>openocd</strong> repository and compile:</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code
cd openocd-code
./bootstrap
./configure --enable-sysfsgpio --enable-bcm2835gpio
make
sudo make install
</code></pre></div>

<p>The list of interfaces that openOCD can use is under: <em>/usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/interface</em>.</p>
<p>In order to use the <a href="http://www.arm.com/products/system-ip/debug-trace/coresight-soc-components/serial-wire-debug.php">SWD connector</a> that the SCK features, by using <em>Bit Banging</em>, we connect it directly to the Raspberry Pi GPIOs:</p>

<h3 id="running-openocd-on-the-raspberry-pi">Running OpenOCD on the raspberry pi<a class="headerlink" href="#running-openocd-on-the-raspberry-pi" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Once you are logged into the raspberry Pi you need a openOCD config file to start (ej. <em>sck.cfg</em>) with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>source [find interface/raspberrypi2-native.cfg]
transport select swd

set CHIPNAME at91samd21g18
source [find target/at91samdXX.cfg]

adapter_nsrst_delay 100
adapter_nsrst_assert_width 100

init
targets
reset halt
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can store this file in OpenOCD scripts dir so it will auto find it</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo mv sck.cfg /usr/local/share/openocd/scripts/
</code></pre></div>

<p>and then run the OpenOCD server with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo openocd -f sck.cfg
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then you can connect to OpenOCD, if you want to connect from an external computer, replace <code>127.0.0.1</code> with your Raspberry Pi IP address.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>telnet 127.0.0.1 4444
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition example">

<p>The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is going on “inside” another program while it executes—or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.</p>
<p>GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
* Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.
* Make your program stop on specified conditions.
* Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.
* Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.</p>

<p>Once your raspberry pi is setup with above instructions you can just do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh pi@RaspberryAddress sudo openocd -f sck.cfg &amp;
cd /platformio_project/path
arm-none-eabi-gdb ./pioenvs/zeroUSB/firmware.elf
(gdb) target remote RaspberryAddress:3333
(gdb) monitor reset run
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are using <em>platformio</em>, you need to modify the compiling option to avoid optimisation with -0g message to the compiler. In case you are not using <em>platformio</em>, activate verbose compiling output at Arduino IDE and find your compiled .elf directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[env:zeroUSB]
platform = atmelsam
board = zeroUSB
framework = arduino
build_flags = -Og
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now we are all set and ready to go. The debugger is waiting for instructions on the execution, which we detail below.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p><strong>Quick handy instructions inside GDB environment</strong>
1. <em>(gdb)</em> appears in every line and you don't have to type it each time
2. In case you need to exit GDB, just type in <code>quit</code>, but remember always killing the process before, should you have a target running

<p>An <strong>extract</strong> of some useful commands are detailed below:</p>
<h4 id="continuing-and-stepping">Continuing and stepping<a class="headerlink" href="#continuing-and-stepping" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p><code>continue [ignore-count]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Resumes program execution until next breakpoint. <code>[ignore-count]</code> argument allows to specify a further number of times to ingore a breakpoint.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, tick () at src/HOLA.cpp:9
9   void tick() {
</code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p><code>step count</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Continues running your program until control reaches a <strong>different source line</strong>, only availabe for source lines and functions compiled with debugging information. <code>count</code> is optional and states the number of steps to be performed before stopping, if no breakpoint arrives earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>next [count]</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to the next source line <strong>without going into functions</strong>. It has the same functionality as step, but it stays in the same stack frame. <code>count</code> works as in <code>step count</code>. As well, it understands jumps calls as in the end of <code>for</code> loops and return to the beginning of the loop.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p><code>set step-mode on/off</code> sets the behaviour of <code>(gdb)</code> when stepping into a function with no debugging information. In the case of <code>step-mode on</code>, it inspects the first line of code of the function, whereas on <code>step-mode off</code> it skips the function completely.</p>
</div>
<p><code>finish</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Continue running until <strong>just after function in the selected stack frame returns</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>until</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Has the same behaviour as <code>step</code>, but it <strong>ignores the jumps between lines due to loops</strong> (for, whiles, etc), continuing to the next source code with incremental line number.</li>

<p><code>load filename offset</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Load</code> it is meant to make filename (an executable) available for debugging on the remote system—by downloading it. <code>load</code> also records the filename symbol table in GDB, like the add-symbol-file command. The file is loaded at whatever address is specified in the executable, also into flash memory.</li>

<h3 id="making-changes-in-the-code">Making changes in the code<a class="headerlink" href="#making-changes-in-the-code" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Anytime we make a change in the code, we don't need to reload the debugging session. We can easily do so by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compile the code:
    a. Define Shell build in Sublime Text and configure a build sytem with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;shell_cmd&quot;: &quot;cd .. &amp;&amp; pio run&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, everytime you hit Ctrl+B (Cmd+B) and you use your custom build system, it will automatically use this option.</p>
<p>b. Or hit <code>pio run</code> in another terminal located in your project root directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In gdb, <code>load</code> file. This will reload the file defined at the beginning of your debugging session and upload it to the target
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>(gdb) load
Loading section .text, size 0x2e50 lma 0x2000
Loading section .ramfunc, size 0x60 lma 0x4e50
Loading section .data, size 0x110 lma 0x4eb0
Start address 0x2910, load size 12224
Transfer rate: 3 KB/sec, 4074 bytes/write.
</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>Keep debugging</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="tui">TUI<a class="headerlink" href="#tui" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>GDB has a console GUI option available with the command line option <strong>--tui</strong>
In the upper frame you can see the code that's being executed.</p>

<h4 id="gdb-init-file">GDB init file<a class="headerlink" href="#gdb-init-file" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>From this <a href="https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard">example dashboard</a> we can generate a custom .gdbinit file for the SCK which will be placed in the HOME directory... (ON GOING)</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">Info</p>
<p>Would be interesting to generate a custom option for production validation and one for internal debugging purposes</p>
